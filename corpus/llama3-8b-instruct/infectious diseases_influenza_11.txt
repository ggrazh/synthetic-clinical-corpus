**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Patient Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1990
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 15, 2023

**Clinical Summary:**

Jane Doe, a 33-year-old female, was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of fever, cough, and sore throat. She presented with a 3-day history of symptoms, which were initially attributed to a viral upper respiratory tract infection. However, upon further evaluation, she was diagnosed with influenza A (H3N2) using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing.

**Hospital Course:**

The patient was initially treated with supportive care, including hydration, antipyretics, and rest. Due to her high risk status (pregnant and having a compromised immune system), antiviral therapy was initiated with Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day. She was also prescribed Zanamivir 2 puffs (10 mg) twice a day for her respiratory symptoms.

On March 12, 2023, the patient's oxygen saturation levels began to decline, requiring supplemental oxygen therapy. A chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia. Pulse oximetry showed oxygen saturation levels of 88% on room air, which improved to 92% with supplemental oxygen.

**Laboratory Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC 12,000/mm³, Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL, Platelet Count 250,000/mm³
* Blood Chemistry: Electrolyte levels within normal range, Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL, Glucose 90 mg/dL
* RT-PCR: Influenza A (H3N2) positive
* Chest X-ray: Bilateral interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia

**Medications:**

* Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day
* Zanamivir 2 puffs (10 mg) twice a day
* Aspirin-free analgesics (Acetaminophen) as needed
* Oxygen therapy (2 L/min via nasal prongs)

**Discharge Instructions:**

* Continue Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for the next 5 days
* Take Zanamivir 2 puffs (10 mg) twice a day for the next 5 days
* Rest and hydrate frequently
* Monitor oxygen saturation levels and seek medical attention if they decline
* Follow up with primary care physician in 7 days to reassess respiratory status

**Recommendations:**

* Continue antiviral therapy as prescribed to prevent complications and reduce symptom severity
* Monitor for signs of secondary bacterial pneumonia, such as worsening cough, fever, or respiratory distress
* Consider antibiotics if signs of secondary bacterial pneumonia develop

**Conclusion:**

Jane Doe was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit with a diagnosis of influenza A (H3N2) and treated with supportive care and antiviral therapy. She required supplemental oxygen therapy due to declining oxygen saturation levels and was discharged with a regimen of Oseltamivir and Zanamivir to complete a 5-day course. Close follow-up with primary care physician is recommended to reassess respiratory status and monitor for potential complications.
