**Admission and Diagnosis:**

Emily Johnson, a 25-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of severe thirst, frequent urination, and unintentional weight loss. After a thorough evaluation, she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis was confirmed by a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 350 mg/dL (19.4 mmol/L) and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level of 11.2%.

**Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, Emily was found to be dehydrated and electrolyte-depleted. She was treated with intravenous fluids and insulin to control her blood glucose levels. She was also started on metformin 500mg twice daily to help regulate her blood glucose levels.

On March 12, 2023, Emily underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which confirmed the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Her HbA1C level was repeated on March 15, 2023, and it showed a significant reduction to 8.5% after initiation of insulin therapy.

**Insulin Therapy:**

Emily was started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen, consisting of:

* Lantus (insulin glargine) 10 units at bedtime
* NovoLog (insulin aspart) 10 units before meals

Her insulin doses were adjusted based on her blood glucose levels, which were monitored regularly throughout her hospital stay.

**Complications and Co-morbidities:**

Emily was found to have mild peripheral neuropathy, which was managed with regular foot examinations and education on proper foot care. She was also started on a statin medication, simvastatin 20mg daily, due to her family history of cardiovascular disease.

**Education and Discharge Instructions:**

Emily was educated on the management of her type 1 diabetes, including the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring, insulin administration, and proper foot care. She was also instructed on the recognition and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

**Discharge Medications:**

* Lantus (insulin glargine) 10 units at bedtime
* NovoLog (insulin aspart) 10 units before meals
* Metformin 500mg twice daily
* Simvastatin 20mg daily
* Aspirin 81mg daily

**Follow-up:**

Emily is scheduled to follow up with the endocrinology department in two weeks for a check-up and to adjust her insulin doses as needed. She will also be seen by a podiatrist for regular foot examinations.

**Additional Recommendations:**

* Regular blood glucose monitoring and insulin administration as instructed
* Proper foot care and regular foot examinations
* Annual spot or 24-hour urine testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine measurement
* Annual ophthalmologic examination
* Annual lipid profile check
* Annual influenza vaccination

**Conclusion:**

Emily Johnson was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and was treated with insulin therapy and metformin. She was educated on the management of her diabetes and was discharged with a regimen of insulin, metformin, and statin medication. She will require regular follow-up appointments to monitor her blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin doses as needed.
