**Chief Complaint:**

John Doe, a 28-year-old male, was admitted to the traumatology unit on March 10, 2023, after a motorcycle accident. He presented with severe pain and swelling in his left elbow.

**History of Present Illness:**

On admission, John reported a sudden onset of pain and stiffness in his left elbow while riding his motorcycle. He was unable to move his elbow and described a loud snapping sound at the time of injury. He denied any previous injuries to the affected area.

**Physical Examination:**

Upon admission, John's physical examination revealed a swollen and tender left elbow with limited range of motion. Neurovascular examination showed normal distal pulses, and motor and sensory function of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves was intact.

**Imaging Studies:**

A true lateral x-ray of the elbow was performed on March 11, 2023, which revealed a displaced posteriorly fractured distal humerus with joint effusion. The anterior humeral line deviated from the middle of the capitellum, indicating posterior displacement. A posterior fat pad was also noted, suggesting joint effusion.

**Diagnosis:**

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies, John was diagnosed with a displaced posteriorly fractured distal humerus with joint effusion.

**Treatment:**

John was treated with analgesics, including acetaminophen 325mg every 4 hours as needed, and ibuprofen 400mg every 6 hours as needed, to manage his pain and inflammation. He was also prescribed an antibiotic, cephalexin 500mg every 6 hours, to prevent infection.

On March 15, 2023, John underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) by an orthopedic surgeon. The surgery was successful in reducing the fracture and stabilizing the joint.

**Postoperative Course:**

Postoperatively, John was managed with a splint to maintain reduction and promote healing. He was instructed to keep his elbow in a sling and avoid heavy lifting or bending. He was also advised to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon in 1 week to assess the fracture's progress.

**Discharge Instructions:**

At the time of discharge, John was instructed to continue taking his medications as prescribed and to follow up with an orthopedic surgeon in 1 week. He was also advised to rest his arm, avoid heavy lifting or bending, and to use a sling to support his elbow.

**Follow-up:**

John will follow up with an orthopedic surgeon in 1 week to assess the fracture's progress and to remove any sutures or staples. He will also be scheduled for a repeat x-ray to evaluate the fracture's healing.

**Final Diagnosis:**

John Doe was diagnosed with a displaced posteriorly fractured distal humerus with joint effusion, treated with open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) and management with a splint and follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon.
