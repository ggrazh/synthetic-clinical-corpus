He had a family history of diabetes and was diagnosed with hypertension 5 years ago. He had been experiencing these symptoms for the past 2 months and had been ignoring them, thinking they were related to his age.

On the second day of admission, John's FPG level was found to be 220 mg/dL (12.2 mmol/L), indicating diabetes mellitus. A glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) test was also ordered and returned a value of 8.5%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

In terms of medication, John was prescribed metformin 500 mg orally twice a day, as the first-line oral medication for type 2 diabetes. He was also started on insulin glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime to control his blood glucose levels.
