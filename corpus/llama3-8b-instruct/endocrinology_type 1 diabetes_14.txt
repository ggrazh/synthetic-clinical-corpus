**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: January 12, 1995
* Admit Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 20, 2023

**Medical History:**

John Doe, a 28-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a two-week history of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. He presented to the emergency department with a blood glucose level of 450 mg/dL (25 mmol/L) and was subsequently transferred to our unit for further evaluation and management.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**

The patient underwent a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) measurement, and oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). The FPG test revealed a level of 270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L), while the HbA1C measurement showed a level of 11.2%. The OGTT demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance. The patient's symptoms, combined with these laboratory results, strongly suggested the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.

**Treatment and Management:**

The patient was started on a regimen of basal-bolus insulin therapy, with a total daily dose of 60 units of insulin glargine (Lantus) and 30 units of insulin aspart (NovoLog) before meals. The patient was also prescribed metformin (500 mg twice daily) as an adjunctive therapy to help improve insulin sensitivity.

**Medications:**

* Insulin glargine (Lantus): 60 units daily, administered at bedtime
* Insulin aspart (NovoLog): 30 units before breakfast and 30 units before dinner
* Metformin (Glucophage): 500 mg twice daily

**Dietary and Lifestyle Recommendations:**

The patient was educated on a balanced diet, focusing on whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and moderate protein intake. He was advised to limit his intake of added sugars, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates. The patient was also encouraged to engage in regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. He was taught to monitor his blood glucose levels regularly and adjust his insulin doses accordingly.

**Monitoring and Follow-up:**

The patient will be followed up in the outpatient endocrinology clinic in one week for a post-discharge visit and to adjust his medication regimen as needed. He will also be scheduled for annual foot examinations, funduscopic examinations by an ophthalmologist, and lipid profile checks.

**Patient Education:**

The patient was educated on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. He was also informed about the importance of regular self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, insulin dose adjustments, and the need for ongoing education and support.

**Discharge Instructions:**

The patient was provided with a comprehensive discharge packet containing instructions on medication use, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle modifications. He was advised to contact his healthcare provider if he experiences any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or if he has any concerns or questions about his medication regimen.

**Follow-up Care:**

The patient will be monitored closely in the outpatient setting to ensure optimal glycemic control and to adjust his medication regimen as needed. He will also be encouraged to participate in regular physical activity and to maintain a healthy lifestyle to manage his diabetes effectively.
