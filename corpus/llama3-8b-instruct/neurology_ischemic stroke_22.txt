**Acute Treatment:**

* Patient received IV antihypertensive therapy with labetalol 20 mg every 6 hours to manage blood pressure.
* Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg IV (maximum 90 mg), with 10% given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes.
* Mechanical thrombectomy was not performed due to the presence of salvageable brain tissue.
* Aspirin 81 mg was administered within 48 hours of stroke onset.
* Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel 75 mg was started on day 2 of hospitalization.

**Hospital Course:**

* Patient was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, and remained for 5 days.

**Future Follow-up:**

* Patient will be followed up with a neurology consultation in 6 weeks to assess for any signs of stroke recurrence or complications.

**Conclusion:**

* Patient was diagnosed with ischemic stroke, left middle cerebral artery territory, and received acute treatment with IV antihypertensive therapy, tPA, and mechanical thrombectomy was not performed.
* Patient's symptoms improved significantly during hospitalization, and patient was discharged on a regimen of antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications for secondary prevention.
* Patient will require ongoing follow-up and rehabilitation therapy to improve functional abilities and prevent stroke recurrence.
