**Admission Workup:**

Upon admission, Jane underwent a comprehensive metabolic panel, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) tests. Her FPG level was 240 mg/dL and HbA1C level was 7.8%. These values confirmed the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

**Hospital Course:**

During her hospital stay, Jane received patient education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. She was also instructed on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake.

**Medications:**

Jane was prescribed metformin 500 mg twice daily, starting on March 12, 2023. She was also provided with insulin aspart 10 units before breakfast and 10 units before dinner, starting on March 15, 2023. GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 2.4 mg was added on March 17, 2023, for weight loss.

**Weight Loss:**

Jane was encouraged to aim for a 5-10% weight loss over the next 6 months. She was advised to consider GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, or a dual incretin agonist for weight loss, taking into account her patient-specific factors such as the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.
