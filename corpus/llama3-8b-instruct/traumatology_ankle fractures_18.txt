**Admission Diagnosis:**

* Right ankle fractures, including a displaced fracture of the medial malleolus and a fracture of the fibula shaft (Maisonneuve fracture)

**Initial Assessment:**

* Patient was evaluated in the emergency department and found to have severe tenderness and swelling in the right ankle. Ankle x-rays were taken in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique (mortise) views, which confirmed the fracture diagnosis.

**Treatment:**

* Patient was admitted to the trauma unit and treated with analgesics, including acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed and ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hours as needed.
* The patient was also treated with compression stockings and elevation of the affected leg to reduce swelling.
* On the second day of admission, an external rotation stress x-ray was taken to detect tibiotalar subluxation, which was negative.
* On the third day of admission, a walking boot was applied to the patient's right ankle to immobilize the joint and allow for fracture healing.

**Surgical Intervention:**

* On the fifth day of admission, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of the ankle fracture. The procedure was performed by Dr. Smith, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon.
