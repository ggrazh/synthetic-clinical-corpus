**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: February 10, 1990
* Admission Date: March 15, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 25, 2023
* Room Number: 304
* Attending Physician: Dr. Jane Smith, MD

**Medical History:**

John Doe, a 33-year-old male, was admitted to the traumatology unit on March 15, 2023, after sustaining a distal humeral fracture in a motor vehicle accident. He complained of severe pain and limited mobility in his left elbow. Upon admission, he was found to have a posterior fat pad on a true lateral x-ray of the elbow, which is always abnormal and specific for joint effusion.

**Initial Evaluation and Treatment:**

The patient underwent a comprehensive initial evaluation, which included a complete neurovascular examination. He was found to have a normal distal neurovascular examination, with no signs of compartment syndrome or neurologic deficits. A radiograph of the elbow revealed a displaced posteriorly humeral fracture, which was confirmed by a subsequent computed tomography (CT) scan.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

The patient underwent a series of radiographs and CT scans to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the injury. The radiographs showed a displaced posteriorly humeral fracture with a significant posterior fat pad, indicating joint effusion. The CT scan revealed a comminuted fracture with a large posterior fragment and a significant posterior displacement.

**Treatment and Management:**

The patient was initially treated with pain management and splinting to reduce pain and prevent further injury. He was prescribed acetaminophen 500 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain control, and ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours as needed for inflammation control. He was also prescribed a splint to immobilize the elbow and prevent further displacement.

On March 18, 2023, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) by an orthopedic surgeon. The procedure involved exposing the fracture through a posterior incision, reducing the fracture, and stabilizing it with a plate and screws. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the recovery room for close monitoring.

**Postoperative Course:**

Postoperatively, the patient was monitored closely for signs of complications, such as infection, nerve damage, or vascular compromise. He was prescribed a course of antibiotics for 7 days to reduce the risk of infection. He was also prescribed a pain management regimen, which included acetaminophen 500 mg every 8 hours as needed and ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours as needed.

The patient was discharged on March 25, 2023, with a follow-up appointment scheduled with the orthopedic surgeon for 1 week. He was advised to follow a regimen of physical therapy exercises to improve range of motion and strength in the affected elbow.

**Discharge Instructions:**

The patient was provided with the following discharge instructions:

* Take acetaminophen 500 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain control.
* Take ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours as needed for inflammation control.
* Follow a regimen of physical therapy exercises to improve range of motion and strength in the affected elbow.
* Attend a follow-up appointment with the orthopedic surgeon in 1 week.
* Monitor for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or increased pain, and seek medical attention if symptoms persist or worsen.

**Final Diagnosis:**

The patient was diagnosed with a displaced posteriorly humeral fracture, which was treated with ORIF and stabilization with a plate and screws. He was discharged with a follow-up appointment scheduled with the orthopedic surgeon and a regimen of physical therapy exercises to improve range of motion and strength in the affected elbow.

**Clinical Correlation:**

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings were consistent with a distal humeral fracture. The radiographs and CT scans confirmed the diagnosis, and the patient's response to treatment was consistent with the expected outcome. The patient's follow-up appointment will be crucial in assessing the success of the treatment and identifying any potential complications.
