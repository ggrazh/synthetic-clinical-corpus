**Medical History**

John Doe, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a primary complaint of increased thirst and urination. He reported a 2-month history of these symptoms, which had been gradually worsening over the past few weeks. He also reported a recent weight gain of 10 pounds and increased fatigue. Family history was significant for type 2 diabetes in his maternal grandmother.

**Admission Evaluation**

Upon admission, John's physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 70 beats per minute, and body mass index (BMI) of 32.8 kg/m2. His funduscopic examination was normal, and his foot examination was unremarkable. Laboratory results revealed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 220 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) level of 8.2%. He had a random glucose value of 250 mg/dL.

**Diagnostic Workup**

A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was made based on the results of the FPG and HbA1C levels. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was not performed due to the patient's high FPG level. A urinalysis revealed no significant proteinuria or hematuria.

**Treatment and Management**

John was started on metformin 500 mg twice daily, with instructions to increase the dose to 1000 mg twice daily if his HbA1C level did not improve. He was also advised to make lifestyle changes, including a balanced diet and regular physical activity. He was educated on the importance of monitoring his blood glucose levels and adjusting his medication doses accordingly.
