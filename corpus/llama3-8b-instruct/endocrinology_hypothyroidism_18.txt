**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: January 10, 1980
* Admission Date: March 15, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 25, 2023

**Chief Complaint and Admission Diagnosis:**

Jane Doe, a 43-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 15, 2023, with a chief complaint of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. She was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism based on elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and low serum free T4 levels.

**Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, Jane underwent a thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and radiological imaging. Her physical examination was notable for a goiter, but no other significant findings. Laboratory tests revealed:

* TSH: 30.2 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L)
* Free T4: 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL)
* Complete Blood Count (CBC): Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV): 92 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL), and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH): 30.5 pg (normal range: 27-33 pg)

Radiological imaging, including a thyroid ultrasound, revealed a non-tender, non-inflammatory goiter.

**Treatment and Management:**

Jane was started on levothyroxine therapy, with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day. Her medication regimen was as follows:

* Levothyroxine: 100 mcg orally once a day
* Folic acid: 1 mg orally once a day

Her thyroid function tests were monitored closely, and her TSH levels decreased to 10.2 mIU/L on March 22, 2023. Her free T4 levels increased to 1.2 ng/dL on March 24, 2023.

**Complications and Interventions:**

Jane developed mild anemia during her hospital stay, which was managed with iron supplements and blood transfusions as needed. She also experienced mild hypoxemia, which was treated with oxygen therapy and close monitoring.

**Discharge Instructions:**

Jane was discharged on March 25, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Continue taking levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day
* Monitor her thyroid function tests every 6-8 weeks
* Report any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, or cold intolerance
* Follow up with her primary care physician in 2 weeks for a post-discharge visit

**Follow-up Care:**

Jane is scheduled for follow-up appointments with her primary care physician and endocrinologist to monitor her response to levothyroxine therapy and adjust her medication regimen as needed.

**Conclusion:**

Jane Doe was successfully treated for primary hypothyroidism during her hospital stay. She was discharged with a stable thyroid function profile and a plan for follow-up care.
