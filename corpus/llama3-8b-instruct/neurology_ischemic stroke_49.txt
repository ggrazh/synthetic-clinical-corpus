**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: January 12, 1965
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 22, 2023

**Medical History:**

John Doe, a 58-year-old male, was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of sudden onset of left-sided weakness, facial drooping, and difficulty speaking. He had a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking.

**Clinical Course:**

Upon admission, the patient's National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 18, indicating severe stroke symptoms. A stat CT scan showed no evidence of hemorrhage, and an MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging revealed a large ischemic stroke in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Cardiac evaluation, including ECG, telemetry, and serum troponin, was normal. Vascular imaging with CT angiography (CTA) showed 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

* Laboratory tests: Complete Blood Count (CBC), metabolic panel, PT/PTT, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile were all within normal limits.
* Neuroimaging: CT and MRI scans confirmed the diagnosis of ischemic stroke.
* Vascular imaging: CTA and duplex ultrasonography assessed for arterial stenosis.

**Acute Treatment:**

The patient received the following medications:

* IV antihypertensives: nicardipine 5 mg/hour IV infusion, titrated to maintain a blood pressure < 185/105 mmHg.
* Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA): 0.9 mg/kg IV, given in accordance with American Heart Association guidelines, with 10% given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes. Brain hemorrhage was excluded by CT, and blood pressure was < 185/105 mmHg before administration.
* Antiplatelet therapy: aspirin 325 mg orally, started on admission and continued for 21 days.
* Mechanical thrombectomy: not performed, due to the patient's large vessel occlusion and the presence of salvageable brain tissue.

**Long-term Management:**

* Risk factor control: hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking cessation therapy were initiated.
* Rehabilitation: physical, occupational, and speech therapy were started to address the patient's stroke-related deficits.
* Secondary prevention: aspirin 81-325 mg orally daily, continued for 21 days, and then switched to clopidogrel 75 mg orally daily for an additional 6 months.

**Follow-up:**

The patient will follow up with his primary care physician in 2 weeks to monitor his stroke-related deficits and adjust his medications as needed. He will also attend a stroke rehabilitation program for 3 months.

**Medications:**

* Nicardipine 5 mg/hour IV infusion
* Aspirin 325 mg orally
* Clopidogrel 75 mg orally daily
* Labetalol 20-80 mg orally daily (for hypertension)
* Simvastatin 40-80 mg orally daily (for dyslipidemia)

**Instructions:**

The patient is advised to:

* Take all medications as prescribed
* Report any changes in his stroke-related symptoms to his primary care physician
* Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments
* Avoid smoking and limit his exposure to secondhand smoke
* Follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to control his blood pressure and lipid profile

**Discharge Summary:**

John Doe was discharged from the hospital on March 22, 2023, with significant improvement in his stroke-related symptoms. He will require ongoing management and rehabilitation to optimize his functional recovery.
