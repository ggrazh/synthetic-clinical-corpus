**Admission Diagnosis:**

Upon admission, Jane's fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 420 mg/dL, and her glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was 10.2%. A random plasma glucose measure was also obtained, which showed a value of 360 mg/dL. Based on these values, Jane was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

**Hospital Course:**

During her hospital stay, Jane received a comprehensive evaluation, including a thorough medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and initiated on insulin therapy. She was started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen, which consisted of 10 units of insulin glargine at bedtime and 5 units of insulin aspart before meals. Her blood glucose levels were monitored frequently, and her insulin doses were adjusted accordingly.

**Medications:**

* Insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime
* Insulin aspart 5 units before meals
* Metformin 500 mg twice daily (to be continued as outpatient)

**Laboratory Results:**

**Exercise Recommendations:**

Jane was encouraged to engage in regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes per week. She was advised to consider the timing of exercise in relation to meals and to adjust her insulin doses or carbohydrate intake as necessary to manage hypoglycemia risk during exercise.

**Discharge Instructions:**

Jane was instructed to follow her insulin regimen as prescribed, to monitor her blood glucose levels regularly, and to adjust her diet and exercise habits accordingly. She was also advised to return to the clinic in 2 weeks for follow-up and to report any changes in her symptoms or laboratory results.

**Education:**

Jane received education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. She was also educated on the importance of regular professional podiatric care, vaccinations, and pancreas transplantation as an alternative insulin delivery method.

**Follow-up Care:**

Jane is scheduled for follow-up appointments with the endocrinology team every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter. She will also need to return for annual foot examinations, funduscopic examinations, and urine testing for albuminuria.

**Conclusion:**

Jane Doe was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and was initiated on insulin therapy during her hospital stay. She was educated on the importance of a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and regular monitoring of her blood glucose levels. She is scheduled for follow-up appointments to ensure optimal management of her condition.
