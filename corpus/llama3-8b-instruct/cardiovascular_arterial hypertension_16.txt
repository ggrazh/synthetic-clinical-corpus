Diagnostic testing was performed, including a urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and electrocardiogram (ECG). The results showed no significant abnormalities.

The patient was diagnosed with arterial hypertension, based on the diagnostic criteria outlined above. The treatment goal was set to achieve a BP < 130/80 mmHg.
