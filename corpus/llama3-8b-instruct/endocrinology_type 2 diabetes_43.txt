**Patient Information**

* Name: John Smith
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1975
* Medical Record Number: 123456

**Chief Complaint and Hospital Course**

John Smith, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the Endocrinology Unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of increased thirst, urination, and fatigue over the past three months. He had a family history of type 2 diabetes and was found to have a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 225 mg/dL (12.5 mmol/L) on routine laboratory testing. A glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) test revealed an HbA1C level of 8.2%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

During his hospital stay, John underwent a comprehensive medical evaluation, including a thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. He was found to have no significant comorbidities or complications associated with diabetes.

**Diagnosis and Treatment**

John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and a treatment plan was developed to manage his blood glucose levels and prevent complications. He was started on metformin 500 mg twice daily, which was titrated to 1000 mg twice daily based on his HbA1C levels. He was also instructed to follow a healthy diet, including whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, and to engage in regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week.

In addition, John was educated on the importance of monitoring his blood glucose levels and adjusting his insulin doses based on those levels and his carbohydrate intake. He was also instructed on how to recognize and manage hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

**Medications**

* Metformin 1000 mg twice daily
* Insulin therapy (to be initiated when HbA1C levels are 1.5 to 2.0% above target)

**Dietary Recommendations**

John was advised to follow a healthy diet that focuses on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, accommodating his requirements posed by comorbid conditions. He was also instructed to monitor his carbohydrate intake and adjust his insulin doses based on those levels.

**Physical Activity**

John was advised to engage in regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week, with adjustments for hypoglycemia risk. He was also instructed to monitor his blood glucose levels before and after exercise and to adjust his insulin or carbohydrate intake as necessary to avoid hypoglycemia.

**Weight Loss**

John was considered for weight loss therapy, and a GLP-1 receptor agonist (semaglutide 2.4 mg) was recommended due to his weight loss goals and the potential benefits of weight loss on glucose control.

**Follow-up and Monitoring**

John was scheduled for follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and an endocrinologist to monitor his blood glucose levels, adjust his treatment plan as necessary, and provide ongoing education and support.

**Preventive Care**

John was advised to receive regular professional podiatric care due to his sensory loss and circulatory impairment. He was also vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2.

**Discharge Instructions**

John was instructed to:

* Continue taking metformin 1000 mg twice daily
* Monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust his insulin doses based on those levels and his carbohydrate intake
* Engage in regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week
* Follow a healthy diet that focuses on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates
* Monitor his blood glucose levels before and after exercise and adjust his insulin or carbohydrate intake as necessary to avoid hypoglycemia
* Receive regular professional podiatric care
* Continue to receive vaccinations as recommended

**Conclusion**

John Smith was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was started on a treatment plan to manage his blood glucose levels and prevent complications. He was educated on the importance of monitoring his blood glucose levels, adjusting his insulin doses based on those levels and his carbohydrate intake, and managing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. He was also advised to follow a healthy diet, engage in regular physical activity, and receive regular professional podiatric care. With ongoing monitoring and adjustments to his treatment plan, John is expected to achieve better glucose control and prevent complications associated with type 2 diabetes.
