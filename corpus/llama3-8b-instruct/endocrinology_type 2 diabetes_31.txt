Her medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a smoking history of 10 pack-years.

**Diagnostic Workup**

Emily underwent a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which revealed a peak glucose level of 320 mg/dL at 2 hours. Her HbA1C level was confirmed to be 9.5%, indicating type 2 diabetes. Her lipid profile showed total cholesterol 220 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 140 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 40 mg/dL, and triglycerides 250 mg/dL. Her urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio was 30 mg/g, indicating microalbuminuria.

**Treatment**

Emily was started on a multidisciplinary treatment plan, including dietary counseling, exercise therapy, and pharmacological therapy. She was prescribed metformin 500 mg twice daily, which was titrated to 1000 mg twice daily based on her response to treatment. Her blood glucose levels improved, and her HbA1C level decreased to 7.5% by the 14th day of hospitalization.

Emily was discharged on March 25, 2023, with a plan to follow up with her primary care physician in one week. She was instructed to return to the hospital if she experienced any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, or if her blood glucose levels were not under control. Her HbA1C level will be monitored every three months to assess her response to treatment.

**Conclusion**

Emily Johnson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and was treated with a multidisciplinary approach, including dietary counseling, exercise therapy, and pharmacological therapy. Her blood glucose levels improved significantly, and her HbA1C level decreased from 9.5% to 7.5% during her hospital stay. She was discharged with a plan for follow-up and was instructed on the importance of regular monitoring and adjusting her treatment plan as needed.
