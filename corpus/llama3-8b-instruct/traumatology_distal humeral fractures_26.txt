**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Patient Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1990
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Length of Stay: 7 days

**Clinical Summary:**

John Doe, a 33-year-old male, was admitted to the traumatology unit on March 10, 2023, after presenting to the emergency department with severe elbow pain and swelling following a fall from a bicycle. Initial radiographs revealed a posterior fat pad on a true lateral x-ray of the elbow, indicating a joint effusion. Further imaging, including computed tomography (CT) scans, confirmed the presence of distal humeral fractures, specifically a displaced posteriorly angulated distal humeral fracture.

**Medical History:**

The patient has a significant medical history, including a previous history of trauma to the elbow, which was managed conservatively with physical therapy. He was otherwise healthy and had no significant medical conditions.

**Admission and Management:**

Upon admission, the patient was assessed and stabilized in the emergency department. He was started on intravenous analgesia, including morphine 5mg every 4 hours as needed, and antibiotic coverage with cefazolin 1g every 8 hours. A complete neurovascular examination was performed, which revealed no significant deficits or abnormalities.

The patient was subsequently transferred to the traumatology unit, where he underwent further management, including splinting with a posterior splint to maintain reduction and prevent further displacement. He was also commenced on a regimen of physical therapy to maintain range of motion and prevent stiffness.

**Interventions and Procedures:**

* March 10, 2023: Initial radiographs and CT scans to confirm diagnosis
* March 11, 2023: Splinting with a posterior splint to maintain reduction and prevent further displacement
* March 12, 2023: Commencement of physical therapy to maintain range of motion and prevent stiffness
* March 15, 2023: Follow-up radiographs to assess fracture reduction and stability

**Complications and Adverse Events:**

The patient experienced no significant complications or adverse events during his hospital stay.

**Discharge Instructions:**

The patient was discharged from the hospital on March 17, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Continue to wear the posterior splint for an additional 4 weeks to maintain reduction and prevent further displacement
* Attend follow-up appointments with the orthopedic surgeon as scheduled
* Continue with physical therapy as advised by the physical therapist
* Take oral antibiotic coverage with cephalexin 500mg every 12 hours for 7 days
* Take oral analgesia with acetaminophen 325mg every 4 hours as needed

**Follow-up Care:**

The patient will require close follow-up with the orthopedic surgeon to monitor fracture healing and assess for any potential complications. He will also require ongoing physical therapy to maintain range of motion and prevent stiffness.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was admitted to the traumatology unit with a diagnosis of distal humeral fractures, specifically a displaced posteriorly angulated distal humeral fracture. He underwent splinting and physical therapy during his hospital stay and was discharged with instructions to continue wearing the posterior splint and attending follow-up appointments with the orthopedic surgeon. Close follow-up care will be necessary to monitor fracture healing and assess for any potential complications.
