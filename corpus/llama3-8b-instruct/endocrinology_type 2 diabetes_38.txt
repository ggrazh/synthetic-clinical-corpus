**Initial Evaluation:**

Upon admission, John's fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 220 mg/dL, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was 9.2%. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed, which demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance. A random glucose value of 250 mg/dL was also recorded. Given these findings, John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

A comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and urinalysis were performed to rule out other underlying conditions. An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were also conducted to assess cardiac function. All tests were normal, except for mildly elevated blood pressure.

**Treatment Plan:**

John was started on a regimen of diet, exercise, and patient education. A comprehensive dietary plan was created, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, with individualized recommendations based on his comorbid conditions.

**Medications:**

* Metformin 500 mg twice daily, starting on March 12, 2023
* Insulin glargine 10 units at bedtime, starting on March 15, 2023
* Aspirin 81 mg daily for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease

**Patient Education:**

John received comprehensive education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. He was instructed on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake. He was also advised on the importance of regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes per week, with adjustments for hypoglycemia risk.

**Discharge Instructions:**

John was instructed to:

* Monitor his blood glucose levels at least four times daily
* Adjust his insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake
* Increase physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week
* Attend follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and endocrinologist every 3-4 months
* Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia

**Future Plans:**

John will follow up with his primary care physician in 2 weeks for a blood glucose check and to review his medication regimen. He will also attend a diabetes education class to reinforce his understanding of diabetes management.
