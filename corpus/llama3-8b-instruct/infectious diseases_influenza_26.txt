Jane was treated with symptomatic therapy, including rest, hydration, and antipyretics. Antiviral therapy was initiated with Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, starting on February 11, 2023. She was also prescribed a humidifier to help relieve her cough and congestion.

**Complications:**

During her hospital stay, Jane developed a mild degree of hypoxemia, which was managed with oxygen therapy. She also experienced some nausea and vomiting, which were treated with anti-emetic medication.

**Discharge Instructions:**

Jane was discharged from the hospital on February 17, 2023, with instructions to continue taking Oseltamivir for the remainder of the 5-day treatment course. She was advised to rest and avoid strenuous activities for the next 2 weeks.
