* Fasting plasma glucose: 110 mg/dL.
* ECG: Normal values.
* Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels: Normal values.

**Diagnosis:**

Based on the patient's medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing, the primary diagnosis is arterial hypertension.

**Treatment:**

The patient was started on a treatment regimen aimed at achieving blood pressure targets of < 130/80 mmHg. His initial medication therapy consisted of:

* Lisinopril (Zestril), 20 mg orally once daily.
* Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 12.5 mg orally once daily.

**Lifestyle Modifications:**

The patient was advised to make significant lifestyle modifications to support blood pressure control, including:

* Increased physical activity, aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day.
* Weight loss, aiming for a 10% reduction in body weight over the next 6 months.
* A healthy diet, with a focus on reducing sodium intake to < 1500 mg/day.
* Smoking cessation.

**Discharge Instructions:**

The patient was discharged on March 15, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Continue taking lisinopril (Zestril) 20 mg orally once daily and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 12.5 mg orally once daily.
* Monitor blood pressure at home twice daily, using a properly sized cuff, and bring records to future appointments.
* Adhere to lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, weight loss, and a healthy diet.
* Return for follow-up appointments on April 12, 2023, and every 3 months thereafter to reassess blood pressure and medication effectiveness.
* Call the provider's office if blood pressure exceeds 140/90 mmHg or if symptoms of potential complications develop.

**Follow-up Plan:**

The patient will be followed up in the clinic on a regular basis to reassess blood pressure and medication effectiveness. Blood pressure will be re-evaluated at 3-month intervals, and medication adjustments will be made as necessary. The patient will also be educated on the importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle modifications, as well as the long-term nature of hypertension management.
