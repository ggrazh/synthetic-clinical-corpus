Her body mass index (BMI) was 25.5 kg/m², and she had a normal thyroid gland palpation. She had mild proximal weakness in her upper and lower extremities.

**Laboratory Results**

Laboratory tests revealed the following abnormalities:

* Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 35.2 μU/mL (normal range: 0.4-4.2 μU/mL)
* Serum free thyroxine (FT4): 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.8-1.9 ng/dL)

**Diagnosis**

Based on the laboratory results and physical examination findings, Emily was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism, specifically Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

**Treatment**

Emily was started on levothyroxine sodium (T4) 100 mcg orally once a day, with a plan to adjust the dose every 6 weeks to achieve a free T4 level in the midnormal range. She was also advised to take the medication with a full glass of water and at the same time every day.

**Hospital Course**

Emily's hospital course was uneventful, with no significant complications. She tolerated the medication well, with no adverse effects reported. Her thyroid function tests were repeated on March 17, 2023, which showed a significant improvement in her TSH and FT4 levels.

**Discharge Instructions**

Emily was discharged from the hospital on March 25, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Continue taking levothyroxine sodium 100 mcg orally once a day
* Monitor her thyroid function tests every 6 weeks to adjust her medication dose as needed
* Report any changes in her symptoms or medication side effects to her primary care physician
* Follow a healthy diet and exercise regularly to manage her weight and overall health

**Follow-up**

Emily is scheduled to follow up with her primary care physician in 6 weeks to assess her response to the medication and adjust her dose as needed. She will also be monitored for any signs of hypothyroidism complications, such as anemia, high cholesterol, or heart disease.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, Emily J. Smith was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and was successfully treated with levothyroxine sodium.
