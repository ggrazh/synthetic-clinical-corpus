* Date of Birth: February 12, 1985
* Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
* Date of Discharge: March 25, 2023
* Hospital Number: 123456

**Chief Complaint:**

The patient, Jane Doe, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance.

**History of Present Illness:**

Jane Doe, a 38-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with a 3-month history of worsening symptoms. She reported feeling increasingly fatigued, which had been exacerbated by her recent pregnancy. She also noted a significant weight gain of 15 pounds over the past 2 months. In addition, she reported feeling cold intolerance, particularly in the last few weeks. She denied any recent travel or exposure to sick contacts.

**Physical Examination:**

Upon admission, the patient's physical examination revealed a euthyroid-appearing female with a normal vital sign profile, except for a resting heart rate of 60 beats per minute. Her skin was cool to the touch, and her hair was dry and brittle. She had a moderate degree of edema in her legs.

**Laboratory Results:**

Upon admission, the patient's laboratory results revealed an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 35.6 mU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mU/L) and a low free T4 level of 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). Her complete blood count (CBC) revealed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL. Her lipid profile showed a total cholesterol level of 220 mg/dL, with a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level of 40 mg/dL.

**Diagnosis:**

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was established.

**Treatment:**

The patient was started on levothyroxine sodium (T4) 100 mcg orally once a day, with a gradual increase in dose to achieve a euthyroid state. Her initial dose was adjusted based on her TSH levels, which were monitored closely during her hospital stay.

**Hospital Course:**

The patient's hospital course was uneventful, with no significant complications or adverse reactions to her medications. She was closely monitored for any signs of adrenal crisis, given her underlying hypothyroidism.

**Discharge Instructions:**

At the time of discharge, the patient's TSH level had normalized, and her free T4 level had increased to 1.2 ng/dL. She was discharged on levothyroxine sodium (T4) 125 mcg orally once a day, with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician in 2 weeks for a follow-up appointment.

**Medications:**

* Levothyroxine sodium (T4) 100 mcg orally once a day, gradually increased to 125 mcg orally once a day
* Folic acid 1 mg orally once a day (for anemia prophylaxis)

**Follow-up:**

The patient was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician in 2 weeks to reassess her thyroid function and adjust her medication as needed.

**Patient Education:**

The patient was educated on the importance of adherence to her medication regimen and the need for regular follow-up appointments to monitor her thyroid function. She was also advised to report any symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, cold intolerance, or dry skin, to her primary care physician.

**Discharge Summary:**

In conclusion, Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and treated with levothyroxine sodium (T4) 125 mcg orally once a day. Her hospital course was uneventful, and she was discharged with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician in 2 weeks.
