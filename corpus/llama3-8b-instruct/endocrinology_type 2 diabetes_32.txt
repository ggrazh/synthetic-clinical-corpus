John Doe, a 43-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit of our hospital on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of increased thirst and urination. He reported a 2-month history of these symptoms, which had been worsening over the past 6 weeks. He also mentioned a 15-pound weight loss over the past 3 months.

**Initial Evaluation:**

Upon admission, John's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, pulse of 70 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. His physical examination was unremarkable, with no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or retinopathy.

**Laboratory Results:**

Initial laboratory results revealed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) value of 9.2%. These values were consistent with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

To confirm the diagnosis, John underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which revealed a 2-hour glucose value of 220 mg/dL (12.2 mmol/L). He also underwent a foot examination, which revealed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy or foot ulcers.

**Treatment:**

John was started on metformin 500 mg twice daily, which was titrated up to 1000 mg twice daily based on his HbA1C levels. He was also prescribed a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, for weight loss and glycemic control.

**Patient Education:**

John received extensive education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. He was instructed on how to adjust his insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake. He was also educated on the importance of regular physical activity, including at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, and the need for regular monitoring of his blood glucose levels.

**Dietary Recommendations:**

John was advised to follow a balanced diet that focuses on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. He was instructed to avoid sugary drinks and foods high in added sugars, saturated fats, and sodium.

**Physical Activity:**

John was encouraged to engage in both aerobic and resistance exercises to improve his overall health and glycemic control. He was also advised to monitor his blood glucose levels before and after exercise to avoid hypoglycemia.

**Follow-up Care:**

John was scheduled for follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and endocrinologist every 3 months to monitor his progress and adjust his treatment plan as needed. He was also instructed to return to the hospital if he experienced any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
