**Hospital Course:**

The patient was started on levothyroxine therapy at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, as per the guidelines for primary hypothyroidism. Her medications included:

* Levothyroxine: 100 mcg orally once a day
* Multivitamin: 1 tablet orally once a day

The patient's thyroid function tests (TFTs) were monitored regularly, and her TSH level decreased to 1.5 μU/mL on March 17, 2023. Her free T4 level increased to 1.2 ng/dL, indicating normalization of thyroid hormone levels.
