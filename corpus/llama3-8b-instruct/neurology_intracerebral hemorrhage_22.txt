**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1980
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Admission Time: 10:45 AM

**Chief Complaint and Reason for Admission:**

John Doe, a 43-year-old male, was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, after presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe headache, left-sided weakness, and altered mental status. The patient had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking.

**Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, the patient was found to be hypertensive, with a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg. His blood glucose level was 120 mg/dL, and complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies (INR, PTT, platelet count) were ordered. A CT scan of the head revealed an intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the left frontal lobe, measuring approximately 3.5 cm in diameter. The patient was immediately started on antihypertensive therapy with nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV, increased by 2.5 mg/hour every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed, to lower his blood pressure to a systolic BP of 140 mmHg.

The patient's neurological examination revealed left-sided weakness, with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. He was also found to have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12. The patient's blood pressure was closely monitored, and his electrolyte levels were checked regularly to avoid hypotensive episodes.

**Diagnostic Imaging and Procedures:**

A CT angiography was performed on March 11, 2023, which showed areas where contrast extravasated into the clot, indicating ongoing bleeding and suggesting poor outcome. A lumbar puncture was not performed, as the patient's neurological examination and CT scan findings were consistent with ICH.

**Treatment and Management:**

The patient was treated with anticonvulsant medication, levetiracetam 1,000 mg PO twice daily, as he had a history of seizure disorder. His antihypertensive medication, lisinopril 20 mg PO daily, was held due to the diagnosis of ICH.

The patient's blood pressure was closely monitored, and his systolic blood pressure was maintained between 130-140 mmHg. His blood glucose level was also closely monitored, and insulin therapy was started as needed to maintain a blood glucose level between 80-120 mg/dL.

**Discharge Summary:**

John Doe was discharged from the hospital on March 20, 2023, after making significant improvement in his neurological status. His blood pressure was well-controlled, and his blood glucose level was within normal limits. His left-sided weakness had improved, and his NIHSS score had decreased to 6.

The patient was advised to continue his antihypertensive medication, lisinopril 20 mg PO daily, once he was stable and able to take oral medications. He was also advised to follow up with his primary care physician for further evaluation and management of his risk factors for ICH.

**Follow-up Instructions:**

The patient is to follow up with his primary care physician in one week for further evaluation and management of his risk factors for ICH. He is also advised to follow up with the neurology department in two weeks for a follow-up appointment.

**Medications:**

* Nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV, increased by 2.5 mg/hour every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed
* Levetiracetam 1,000 mg PO twice daily
* Lisinopril 20 mg PO daily (held during hospital stay)

**Allergies:**

* None

**Special Instructions:**

* The patient is to avoid sudden changes in position or activities that may increase his blood pressure.
* He is to follow up with his primary care physician and the neurology department as instructed.
* He is to take his medications as instructed and report any side effects or concerns to his healthcare provider.
