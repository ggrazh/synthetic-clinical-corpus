**Patient Information:**

* Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1985
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 20, 2023
* Room Number: Endocrinology Unit 304

**Admission Diagnosis:**

* Hypothyroidism, Primary (confirmed by laboratory tests)

**Admission History:**

Jane Doe, a 38-year-old female, was admitted to the Endocrinology Unit on March 10, 2023, with a complaint of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. She reported a recent history of decreased energy, difficulty concentrating, and a sensation of cold intolerance, which had been worsening over the past few months. She denied any significant medical history, but mentioned that her mother had been treated for hypothyroidism.

**Physical Examination:**

On admission, Jane Doe's vital signs were: temperature 98.6Â°F, pulse 72 beats per minute, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. Her physical examination revealed a normal appearance, with no signs of thyrotoxicosis or myxedema. Her thyroid gland was normal in size and consistency.

**Laboratory Results:**

* Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): 25.6 mU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mU/L)
* Serum free thyroxine (T4): 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL)
* Serum triiodothyronine (T3): 80 ng/dL (normal range: 60-180 ng/dL)
* Complete Blood Count (CBC): Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL (normal range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL), Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 90 fL (normal range: 80-100 fL)
* Lipid Profile: Total Cholesterol 240 mg/dL (normal range: 150-200 mg/dL), Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol 160 mg/dL (normal range: 70-130 mg/dL)

**Treatment and Management:**

Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism, and treatment was initiated with levothyroxine sodium tablets, 100 mcg orally once a day, starting on March 12, 2023. The medication was increased to 125 mcg orally once a day on March 17, 2023, based on laboratory results and clinical response.

**Hospital Course:**

During her hospital stay, Jane Doe was monitored closely for any signs of myxedema coma, which was ruled out based on the absence of severe hypothyroid symptoms and laboratory results. She was also treated for anemia with oral iron supplements, 325 mg three times a day, starting on March 15, 2023.

**Discharge Instructions:**

Jane Doe was discharged from the hospital on March 20, 2023, with a prescription for levothyroxine sodium tablets, 125 mcg orally once a day, to be taken indefinitely. She was instructed to follow up with her primary care physician in one month for a check-up and to adjust her medication as needed. She was also advised to maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid excessive heat or cold exposure.

**Follow-up Care:**

A follow-up appointment with the endocrinologist was scheduled for April 20, 2023, to monitor her response to treatment and adjust her medication as needed. It is recommended that Jane Doe have regular thyroid function tests, including TSH and free T4 levels, to ensure that her hypothyroidism is well-controlled.

**Special Instructions:**

Jane Doe was advised to avoid taking medications that can decrease T4 absorption or increase its metabolic clearance, such as antacids, cholestyramine, or rifampin. She was also instructed to notify her healthcare provider if she experiences any signs of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, or cold intolerance, or if she has any questions or concerns about her medication.

By following these instructions and attending her scheduled follow-up appointments, Jane Doe can ensure that her hypothyroidism is well-controlled and that she can lead a normal, healthy life.
