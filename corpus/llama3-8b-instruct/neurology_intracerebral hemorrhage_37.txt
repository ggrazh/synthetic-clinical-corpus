**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1975
* Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
* Date of Discharge: March 17, 2023

**Chief Complaint:**

John Doe, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, with a sudden onset of severe headache, left-sided weakness, and impaired consciousness. He reported a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking.

**Initial Evaluation:**

Upon admission, John's vital signs were: blood pressure 180/100 mmHg, pulse 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. His complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies (INR, PTT, platelet count) were within normal limits. Blood glucose level was measured at the bedside and found to be 120 mg/dL, ruling out hypoglycemia as a cause of his symptoms.

**Imaging Studies:**

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was performed, which revealed a large intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the left frontal lobe, measuring approximately 5 cm in diameter. A spot sign was noted on the CT angiography, indicating ongoing bleeding. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed, which confirmed the ICH and showed no signs of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

**Management and Treatment:**

John was treated with immediate blood pressure management to prevent further bleeding. His blood pressure was stabilized using nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV, increased by 2.5 mg/hour every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed. His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 140 mmHg and 160 mmHg throughout his hospital stay.

Anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications were discontinued, and fresh frozen plasma was administered to reverse the effects of his anticoagulant medications. Idarucizumab was not necessary, as he was not taking dabigatran.

**Surgical Intervention:**

Surgical evacuation of the ICH was not deemed necessary, as the hematoma was not causing midline shift or herniation. Instead, John was treated conservatively with close monitoring of his blood pressure and neurologic status.

**Complications and Course:**

John developed hypertension-related acute kidney injury on day 3 of his admission, which was managed with fluids and diuretics. He also experienced seizures on day 5, which were treated with antiseizure medications. Hydrocephalus was not present, and an external ventricular drain was not necessary.

**Discharge Summary:**

John was discharged from the hospital on March 17, 2023, with a diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage. His blood pressure was well-controlled, and his neurologic status was stable. He was advised to continue his antihypertensive medications and to follow up with his primary care physician for further management.

**Medications:**

John was prescribed the following medications during his hospital stay:

* Nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV, increased by 2.5 mg/hour every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed
* Fresh frozen plasma (2 units)
* Antiseizure medications (phenobarbital 20 mg PO TID)

**Recommendations:**

John was advised to:

* Attend follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and neurologist
* Continue his antihypertensive medications as prescribed
* Report any seizure activity or worsening neurologic symptoms to his healthcare provider immediately
* Avoid anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications

**Follow-up:**

John will follow up with his primary care physician in one week and with his neurologist in two weeks. He will be monitored for any signs of worsening neurologic symptoms or bleeding.

**Final Diagnosis:**

John Doe was diagnosed with an intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, which was treated conservatively with close monitoring of his blood pressure and neurologic status.
