**Dietary Recommendations:**

Jane was educated on a personalized dietary plan, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. She was advised to limit her carbohydrate intake to 45-50% of her total daily calories, with a target goal of 150-200 mg/dL for her postprandial blood glucose levels.

* Regular professional podiatric care
