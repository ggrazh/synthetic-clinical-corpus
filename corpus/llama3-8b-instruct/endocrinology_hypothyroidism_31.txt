**Patient Information:**

* Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1985
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 20, 2023
* Room Number: 304
* Primary Diagnosis: Hypothyroidism

**Admission and Initial Workup:**

Jane Doe, a 38-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss over the past six months. She reported no significant medical history, but her family history was significant for hypothyroidism in her mother and sister. Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, with a TSH of 30.5 μIU/mL (normal range: 0.4-4.0 μIU/mL) and a free thyroxine (T4) level of 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). Her serum cholesterol level was 240 mg/dL, and her hemoglobin level was 13.5 g/dL.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**

Further evaluation revealed normal circulating levels of triiodothyronine (T3), and her serum cortisol level was within normal limits. A complete blood count (CBC) showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.5 g/dL. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) was normal, and her echocardiogram revealed no significant cardiac abnormalities.

**Treatment and Management:**

Based on the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, Jane Doe was started on levothyroxine therapy with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day. Her medication regimen also included a daily multivitamin and an iron supplement to address her anemia. She was advised to take her medications at the same time each day, with a full glass of water.

**Course of Hospitalization:**

During her hospital stay, Jane Doe's laboratory tests showed a gradual improvement in her TSH and T4 levels. Her TSH level decreased to 15.2 μIU/mL on March 15, 2023, and her T4 level increased to 1.2 ng/dL on March 18, 2023. She remained asymptomatic and was able to tolerate her medications without any adverse effects.

**Discharge Instructions:**

Jane Doe was discharged on March 20, 2023, with instructions to continue taking her medications as prescribed and to follow up with her primary care physician in two weeks. She was advised to return to the hospital if she experienced any signs of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, or hair loss, and to report any changes in her medication regimen or medical history.

**Medications:**

* Levothyroxine: 100 mcg orally once a day
* Multivitamin: 1 tablet daily
* Iron supplement: 1 tablet daily

**Follow-up:**

Jane Doe is scheduled to follow up with her primary care physician in two weeks to assess her response to levothyroxine therapy. She will also have her laboratory tests repeated to ensure that her thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range.

**Conclusion:**

Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and treated with levothyroxine therapy. Her laboratory tests showed a gradual improvement in her thyroid hormone levels during her hospital stay, and she was able to tolerate her medications without any adverse effects. She was discharged with instructions to continue taking her medications as prescribed and to follow up with her primary care physician in two weeks.
