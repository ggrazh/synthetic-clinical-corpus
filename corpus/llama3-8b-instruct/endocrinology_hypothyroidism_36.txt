**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1985
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 20, 2023
* Unit: Endocrinology

**Medical History:**

Jane Doe, a 38-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, and hair loss. She reported a gradual onset of these symptoms over the past 6 months. She had no significant medical history, but her mother had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism.

**Admission Evaluation:**

Upon admission, Jane's physical examination revealed a mildly obese female with a normal blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Her thyroid gland was normal in size and texture. Her laboratory results showed an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 35.6 mU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.2 mU/L) and a low free thyroxine (T4) level of 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL).

**Diagnostic Workup:**

A thorough diagnostic workup was performed, including a serum TSH measurement, which confirmed primary hypothyroidism. Her serum free T4 level was low, and her serum triiodothyronine (T3) level was normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram revealed no significant cardiac abnormalities.

**Treatment:**

Jane was started on levothyroxine therapy at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, adjusted based on her TSH levels. She was also counseled on the importance of maintaining a consistent medication schedule and monitoring her thyroid function tests.

**Hospital Course:**

During her hospital stay, Jane's symptoms of fatigue and weight gain began to improve, and her laboratory results showed a gradual decrease in her TSH level and an increase in her free T4 level. She was able to tolerate the medication well and had no significant adverse reactions.

**Discharge Instructions:**

At the time of discharge on March 20, 2023, Jane was instructed to continue taking levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day. She was advised to follow up with her primary care physician in 6 weeks for a check-up and to monitor her thyroid function tests. She was also advised to report any changes in her symptoms or side effects to her healthcare provider.

**Medications:**

* Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day
* Multivitamin supplement

**Follow-up Care:**

Jane was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician on April 17, 2023, to monitor her response to treatment and to adjust her medication dose as needed.

**Prognosis:**

With timely treatment and close follow-up care, Jane is expected to have a good prognosis for her hypothyroidism. She will need to continue taking levothyroxine therapy for the remainder of her life to manage her condition.

**Teaching Points:**

* Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that can present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and dry skin.
* Serum TSH measurement is the most sensitive test for diagnosing hypothyroidism.
* Levothyroxine is the preferred medication for hypothyroidism, and the starting dose is usually 100 mcg orally once a day.
* Close monitoring of thyroid function tests is essential to adjust medication doses and ensure optimal treatment.

By following these guidelines, Jane Doe was able to receive appropriate treatment for her hypothyroidism and is expected to have a good outcome.
