**Patient Discharge Summary**

Patient Name: John Doe
Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
Date of Discharge: March 20, 2023
Admitting Diagnosis: Intracerebral Hemorrhage

**Medical History**

John Doe, a 62-year-old male, was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, after presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe headache, left-sided weakness, and impaired consciousness. He had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. His medications included aspirin 81mg daily for cardiovascular prevention and metoprolol 25mg twice daily for hypertension control.

**Clinical Course**

Upon arrival, his blood glucose level was found to be 120mg/dL, which led to a prompt measurement of a complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies (INR, PTT, platelet count). The initial CT scan revealed a large left-sided intracerebral hemorrhage measuring approximately 4.5 cm in diameter, with significant mass effect and midline shift. The patient was treated with 2 liters of normal saline and 1 liter of 3% sodium chloride solution to manage hypertension. Nicardipine 2.5mg/hour IV was initiated to manage hypertension, with adjustments made every 5 minutes as needed to maintain a systolic blood pressure between 140-150 mmHg.

**Diagnostic Workup**

A lumbar puncture was performed to rule out subarachnoid hemorrhage, which was negative. A CT angiography was also performed to assess for areas of contrast extravasation into the clot, which showed the "spot sign" indicating ongoing bleeding. A repeat CT scan on March 12, 2023, revealed no significant change in the hemorrhage size or mass effect.

**Treatment**

Anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications were withheld due to the patient's diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage. The patient was closely monitored for signs of rebleeding, and his blood pressure was carefully managed to avoid high peaks and variability. The goal was to maintain a systolic blood pressure close to 130/80 mmHg.

**Interventions**

The patient was treated with antiseizure medications, levetiracetam 1000mg orally every 8 hours, due to a seizure episode on March 12, 2023. He was also treated with dexamethasone 4mg orally every 6 hours to manage potential cerebral edema.

**Outcomes**

The patient's neurological deficits improved gradually during his hospital stay, with resolution of his left-sided weakness and improved consciousness. He was able to tolerate a regular diet and was ambulatory with assistance.

**Discharge Instructions**

The patient was discharged on March 20, 2023, with the following instructions:

1. Follow-up with his primary care physician within 1 week for blood pressure monitoring and medication adjustment.
2. Continue taking metoprolol 25mg twice daily and levetiracetam 1000mg orally every 8 hours as directed.
3. Monitor his blood pressure regularly and report any changes to his primary care physician.
4. Avoid anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications for at least 2 weeks after discharge.
5. Attend a follow-up appointment with a neurologist in 2 weeks to assess for any neurological deficits or seizure activity.

**Future Follow-up**

The patient will be followed up in 2 weeks to assess for any changes in his neurological deficits or seizure activity. He will also be evaluated for potential cognitive or mood changes, which are common sequelae of intracerebral hemorrhage.
