**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1965
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 25, 2023
* Chief Complaint: Fatigue, increased thirst and urination, and blurred vision

**Admission and Hospital Course:**

John Doe, a 58-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of fatigue, increased thirst and urination, and blurred vision. He had been experiencing these symptoms for the past 6 weeks, and his primary care physician referred him to our hospital for further evaluation and management.

Upon admission, our medical team conducted a thorough physical examination and ordered a battery of laboratory tests, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels. The FPG level was 220 mg/dL (> 11.1 mmol/L), and the HbA1C level was 7.5%. These results were consistent with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

**Diagnosis and Treatment:**

Based on the patient's laboratory results and clinical presentation, we diagnosed John Doe with type 2 diabetes. Our treatment plan included a multidisciplinary approach, involving diet, exercise, patient education, and medications.

Our patient education program covered the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. We also provided detailed education on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake.

Medications were initiated to control John's blood glucose levels. Metformin 500 mg twice daily was prescribed as the first-line oral medication for type 2 diabetes due to its cost-effectiveness and safety profile. Additionally, we started insulin therapy with a basal insulin injection at bedtime to help control his blood glucose levels.

**Dietary Recommendations:**

Our dietary recommendations focused on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, accommodating John's requirements posed by comorbid conditions. We emphasized the importance of portion control, mindful eating, and regular physical activity to help him achieve his weight loss goals.

**Physical Activity:**

We recommended at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, with adjustments for hypoglycemia risk. John was also encouraged to incorporate resistance exercise into his routine to improve his overall health.

**Follow-up and Monitoring:**

John will be seen in follow-up appointments every 2-3 months to monitor his blood glucose levels, adjust his medication regimen as needed, and provide ongoing education and support. We will also be monitoring his kidney function and lipid profile to assess for any potential complications.

**Patient Education and Self-Monitoring:**

We provided John with a blood glucose meter and instructed him on how to use it to monitor his blood glucose levels throughout the day. We also emphasized the importance of regular self-testing and adjusting his insulin doses based on his blood glucose levels.

**Discharge Instructions:**

John was discharged from the hospital on March 25, 2023, with instructions to continue his current medication regimen, follow his dietary recommendations, and engage in regular physical activity. He was also advised to attend follow-up appointments as scheduled and to contact our office if he experiences any concerns or symptoms.

**Summary:**

John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was treated with a multidisciplinary approach involving diet, exercise, patient education, and medications. His treatment plan includes metformin 500 mg twice daily, insulin therapy, and regular follow-up appointments to monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust his medication regimen as needed. We will continue to monitor his kidney function and lipid profile to assess for any potential complications.
