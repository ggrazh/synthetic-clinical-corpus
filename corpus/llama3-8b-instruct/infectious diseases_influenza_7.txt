John Doe, a 33-year-old male, was admitted to the infectious diseases unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of fever, cough, and sore throat, which started on March 7, 2023. He was referred to our hospital by his primary care physician due to concerns of severe respiratory symptoms.

**Clinical Course:**

Upon admission, the patient was found to be febrile, with a temperature of 102°F (39°C), and had a cough productive of yellow sputum. His respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. A thorough physical examination revealed bilateral wheezing and crackles in the lungs. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 12,000/mm³, with 60% neutrophils. A rapid antigen test for influenza was negative, but a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for influenza A and B was positive, confirming the diagnosis of influenza A.

**Diagnostic Studies:**

* Chest x-ray on March 10, 2023, showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates, consistent with primary influenza pneumonia.
* Pulse oximetry on March 10, 2023, revealed an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, which improved to 95% after oxygen therapy.
* Nasopharyngeal swab culture on March 12, 2023, grew influenza A virus, subtype H3N2.

**Treatment and Management:**

The patient was treated with antiviral therapy, specifically oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, starting on March 11, 2023. He also received supportive care, including rest, hydration, and antipyretics. Due to his respiratory symptoms, he was placed on oxygen therapy, which was gradually weaned off over the next few days.

**Medications:**

* Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day (March 11, 2023 - March 15, 2023)

* Cetrizine 10 mg orally daily for allergic reactions

**Progress and Discharge:**

The patient's symptoms gradually improved over the next few days, and his fever resolved on March 13, 2023. His respiratory rate and oxygen saturation improved, and he was able to tolerate oral medications without difficulty. He was discharged from the hospital on March 15, 2023, with instructions to complete a 5-day course of oseltamivir and to follow up with his primary care physician for further evaluation and management.
