**DISCHARGE SUMMARY**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: Emily Johnson
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1995
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 22, 2023

**Admission and Clinical Course:**

Emily Johnson, a 28-year-old female, was admitted to our traumatology unit on March 10, 2023, after presenting to the emergency department with a left elbow injury following a fall from a bicycle. On admission, she complained of severe pain and swelling in the left elbow, with limited range of motion. A physical examination revealed tenderness and swelling in the left elbow, with no palpable deformity or instability.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

A series of radiographs, including anterior-posterior and lateral views, were obtained to evaluate the left elbow. The radiographs revealed a displaced posteriorly angulated distal humeral fracture, with a posterior fat pad sign indicative of joint effusion. A complete neurovascular examination was performed, which demonstrated normal median, radial, and ulnar nerve function, with palpable distal pulses.

**Treatment and Management:**

The patient was treated with analgesics, including acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed, and ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hours as needed, to manage her pain. She was also administered a course of antibiotics, including cefazolin 1g every 8 hours for 24 hours, to cover for potential skin flora.

A splint was applied to the left elbow to maintain reduction and prevent further displacement. The patient was advised to elevate the affected limb and avoid heavy lifting or bending.

**Surgical Intervention:**

Due to the displaced nature of the fracture, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) on March 15, 2023. The procedure was performed by an orthopedic surgeon, who reduced the fracture and stabilized it with a plate and screws. The patient was monitored closely in the post-anesthesia care unit and transferred to the ward for further recovery.

**Post-Operative Course:**

The patient made an uneventful recovery, with progressive improvement in pain and range of motion. She was discharged on March 22, 2023, with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician in 1 week for suture removal and to begin physical therapy.

**Medication Regimen:**

* Acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed for pain management
* Ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hours as needed for pain management
* Cefazolin 1g every 8 hours for 24 hours for antibiotic coverage

**Follow-Up Instructions:**

The patient is advised to follow up with her primary care physician in 1 week for suture removal and to begin physical therapy. She is also instructed to maintain the splint for 6 weeks and to avoid heavy lifting or bending. A follow-up appointment is scheduled with the orthopedic surgeon in 2 weeks to assess the fracture's healing progression.

**Conclusion:**

Emily Johnson was admitted to our traumatology unit with a displaced posteriorly angulated distal humeral fracture. She underwent open reduction with internal fixation and was discharged on March 22, 2023, with instructions to follow up with her primary care physician and orthopedic surgeon. Close monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure proper healing and to address any potential complications.
