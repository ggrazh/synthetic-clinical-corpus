**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1975
* Admit Date: January 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: January 20, 2023
* Hospital Number: 123456

**Clinical Summary:**

John Doe, a 47-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on January 10, 2023, with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. He presented with symptoms of increased thirst and urination, as well as polyphagia, over the past three months.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

Upon admission, John's fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 220 mg/dL, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was 8.5%. A random glucose value was also obtained, which was 250 mg/dL. These values confirmed the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Additional diagnostic tests included a complete blood count (CBC), serum creatinine, and lipid profile, which revealed no significant abnormalities.

**Treatment:**

John was started on metformin 500 mg orally twice daily, and his blood glucose levels were closely monitored. His HbA1C level was reassessed on January 15, 2023, and was found to be 7.2%. Given his continued hyperglycemia, he was initiated on insulin glargine 10 units subcutaneously at bedtime, with a target fasting blood glucose level of 80-110 mg/dL.

**Medications:**

* Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily
* Insulin glargine 10 units subcutaneously at bedtime

**Dietary Recommendations:**

John was educated on the importance of a balanced diet, with a focus on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. He was instructed to consume 45-60% of his daily calories from carbohydrates, 15-20% from protein, and 20-25% from fat. He was also advised to monitor his carbohydrate intake and adjust his insulin doses accordingly.

**Physical Activity:**

John was encouraged to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, with adjustments made for hypoglycemia risk. He was also advised to incorporate resistance exercises into his routine.

**Patient Education:**

John received extensive education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and the importance of regular monitoring of his blood glucose levels. He was also instructed on how to adjust his insulin doses based on his blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake.

**Other Recommendations:**

* John was advised to receive regular professional podiatric care due to sensory loss in his feet.
* He was vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2.
* He was encouraged to engage in regular exercise and maintain a healthy body mass index (BMI) to reduce his risk of developing diabetic complications.

**Follow-up:**

John is scheduled to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks to monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust his treatment plan as necessary. He will also be seen by a registered dietitian to refine his dietary recommendations and a podiatrist to assess his foot health.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was started on metformin and insulin therapy. He received extensive education on the management of his diabetes and was advised to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy diet. He will require ongoing monitoring and adjustments to his treatment plan to achieve optimal blood glucose control and prevent complications.
