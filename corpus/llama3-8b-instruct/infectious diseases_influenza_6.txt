**Admission and Hospital Course:**

John Doe, a 33-year-old male, was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit on March 15, 2023, with a chief complaint of fever, cough, and sore throat. He presented with symptoms consistent with influenza, including a temperature of 102.5Â°F, cough, and mild chest discomfort. He reported no significant medical history, and his medications included only occasional acetaminophen for headaches.

Upon admission, a rapid antigen test was performed, which was negative for influenza. However, due to the high prevalence of influenza in the community, a respiratory viral panel (RVP) was ordered, which subsequently revealed a positive result for influenza A (H3N2) on March 17, 2023.

Meanwhile, the patient's symptoms worsened, and he required oxygen supplementation to maintain a saturation of 92% on room air. A chest x-ray was performed on March 18, 2023, which showed mild bilateral interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia.

* Pulse oximetry: 92% on room air

**Treatment:**

The patient was started on antiviral therapy with oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, initiated on March 19, 2023, based on the hospital's antiviral treatment guidelines. He was also prescribed acetaminophen 325 mg every 4-6 hours as needed for fever and discomfort.

**Medications:**

* Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day
