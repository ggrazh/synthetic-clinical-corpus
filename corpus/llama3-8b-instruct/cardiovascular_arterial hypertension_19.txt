**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1975
* Sex: Male
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 17, 2023

**Medical History:**

John Doe, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of severe headache and dizziness. He reported a history of hypertension, which was diagnosed approximately 5 years ago. He had been taking medications as prescribed but had not been able to control his blood pressure. His symptoms worsened over the past few weeks, prompting him to seek medical attention.

**Physical Examination and Diagnostic Testing:**

Upon admission, John's blood pressure was measured using sphygmomanometry, with readings of 160/100 mmHg, 162/102 mmHg, and 165/105 mmHg taken at different times under specific conditions. His blood pressure was measured in both arms initially, with the right arm showing a higher reading, and subsequently measured only in the right arm. A properly sized BP cuff was used to ensure accurate readings.

A thorough physical examination was performed, including measurement of height (5'9"), weight (190 lbs), waist circumference (42 inches), and evaluation for target organ damage. Laboratory tests ordered included urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, ECG, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. The results revealed no significant abnormalities.

**Diagnosis and Treatment:**

Based on the physical examination and diagnostic testing results, John Doe was diagnosed with arterial hypertension. The diagnosis was made using the average of 2 or 3 measurements taken at different times under specific conditions, as recommended by the guidelines.

Treatment for John's hypertension involved lifestyle modifications, including increased physical activity, weight loss, a healthy diet, reduced sodium intake (targeting < 1000 mg/day), and smoking cessation. He was also started on medication therapy, with an initial dosage of:

* Lisinopril (Zestril), 20 mg orally once daily
* Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), 25 mg orally once daily

The medications were chosen considering contraindications and patient-specific factors. John was educated on the importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle modifications, and he was taught how to monitor his blood pressure at home.

**Course of Hospitalization:**

During his hospital stay, John's blood pressure was closely monitored and adjusted as needed. He received regular education on his condition and treatment plan. He was also counseled on the importance of regular follow-up appointments and self-monitoring of blood pressure.

**Discharge Instructions:**

John was discharged from the hospital on March 17, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Continue lisinopril 20 mg orally once daily and HCTZ 25 mg orally once daily
* Monitor blood pressure at home and record readings
* Increase physical activity and reduce sodium intake
* Follow a healthy diet and consider a low-sodium meal plan
* Quit smoking
* Return for follow-up appointments as scheduled
* Inform healthcare provider of any changes in symptoms or medications

**Follow-up Care:**

John is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with his primary care physician on March 24, 2023, to reassess his blood pressure and medication effectiveness. His blood pressure will be re-evaluated at regular intervals, and adjustments to his treatment plan will be made as needed.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit with a diagnosis of arterial hypertension. He was started on medication therapy and lifestyle modifications, and his blood pressure was closely monitored during his hospital stay. He was discharged with instructions to continue his treatment plan and follow-up appointments. Regular reassessment of his blood pressure and medication effectiveness will be crucial for effective management of his hypertension.
