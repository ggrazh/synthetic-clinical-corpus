The patient, a 58-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit of our hospital with a chief complaint of increased thirst and frequent urination over the past six months. He reported a family history of type 2 diabetes and had been experiencing symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia.

**Medical History**

The patient has a significant medical history, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. He has been taking metformin 500 mg twice daily for the past five years for his hyperglycemia. He has a 20-pack-year history of smoking and has never been diagnosed with cancer. He has no significant allergies or sensitivities.

These results confirmed the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
