**Diagnosis and Management:**

Based on her laboratory results and clinical presentation, Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism. She was started on levothyroxine therapy at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, which was adjusted to 125 mcg orally once a day on March 15, 2023, based on her TSH levels. Her TSH level was rechecked on March 18, 2023, and was found to be 12.5 μU/mL, indicating a good response to therapy.
