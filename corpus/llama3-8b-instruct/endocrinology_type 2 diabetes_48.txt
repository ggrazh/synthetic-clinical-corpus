**Medical History**

John Doe, a 58-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a 2-week history of increasing thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. His medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a 10-pack-year smoking history.

**Admission Diagnosis**

Upon admission, John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes based on the results of a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which revealed a value of 220 mg/dL (> 11.1 mmol/L). His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was 8.2% at the time of admission.

**Hospital Course**

John was initially treated with a diet rich in whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, with a focus on individualized macronutrient recommendations. He was also prescribed metformin 500 mg twice daily for glycemic control. His blood glucose levels were monitored regularly, and he was educated on the importance of blood glucose monitoring and the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

On March 15, 2023, John's HbA1C level decreased to 7.5%, indicating a response to metformin therapy. However, his blood glucose levels remained elevated, with a peak value of 250 mg/dL (> 13.9 mmol/L) on March 17, 2023. As a result, his metformin dosage was increased to 1000 mg twice daily.

In addition to metformin, John was also prescribed semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly for weight loss and glycemic control. He was educated on the importance of adjusting his insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake and was provided with a detailed plan for carbohydrate counting.

**Physical Activity**

John was encouraged to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, with adjustments made for hypoglycemia risk. He was also advised to incorporate resistance exercises into his routine.

**Patient Education**

John received comprehensive education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. He was also educated on the importance of regular follow-up visits and self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.

**Discharge Instructions**

At the time of discharge, John's blood glucose levels were well controlled, with a mean value of 120 mg/dL (> 6.7 mmol/L) over the past 24 hours. He was advised to continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily and semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly. He was also instructed to monitor his blood glucose levels regularly, adjust his insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake, and engage in regular physical activity.

**Follow-up Care**

John was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the endocrinology team on April 10, 2023, to monitor his progress and adjust his treatment plan as needed.

**Recommended Vaccinations**

John was recommended for vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2.

**Conclusion**

John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and treated with metformin and semaglutide. He was educated on the importance of blood glucose monitoring, carbohydrate counting, and physical activity. His blood glucose levels were well controlled at the time of discharge, and he was advised to continue his treatment plan and follow-up with the endocrinology team.
