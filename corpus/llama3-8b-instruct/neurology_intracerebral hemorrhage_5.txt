**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1980
* Admitting Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 25, 2023
* Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, and difficulty speaking

**Medical History:**

* Hypertension (controlled with metoprolol 25mg PO daily) and hyperlipidemia (managed with atorvastatin 20mg PO daily)
* No prior history of bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use

**Admission and Initial Course:**

* Admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, with a sudden onset of severe headache, confusion, and difficulty speaking
* Initial vital signs: Blood pressure 160/100 mmHg, pulse 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air
* Blood glucose level measured at bedside and found to be 120 mg/dL, ruling out hypoglycemia
* Complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies (INR, PTT, platelet count) were within normal limits
* Immediate CT scan revealed a large intracerebral hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe, measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter

**Diagnostic Workup:**

* CT angiography showed areas of contrast extravasation into the clot, indicating ongoing bleeding and suggesting poor outcome
* Lumbar puncture was not necessary as neuroimaging showed no subarachnoid hemorrhage
* No evidence of bleeding disorders or anticoagulant use was found

**Treatment:**

* Anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications were discontinued due to the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage
* Nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV was initiated to lower blood pressure, with a goal of systolic blood pressure < 140 mmHg
* Blood pressure was carefully monitored and adjusted as needed to avoid high blood pressure peaks and variability
* Fresh frozen plasma was administered to reverse the effects of potential anticoagulants
* No surgical evacuation was performed due to the patient's poor neurologic status and the location of the hemorrhage

**Course and Complications:**

* Patient's neurologic status deteriorated, with increasing confusion, decreased level of consciousness, and worsening motor deficits
* Hypertension was well-controlled throughout the hospital stay, with a maximum systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg
* Patient developed hydrocephalus, which was managed with an external ventricular drain
* No seizures were noted, and antiseizure medications were not necessary

**Discharge:**

* Patient was discharged on March 25, 2023, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 6
* Discharge medications included:
	+ Nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV (as needed) for blood pressure control
	+ Fresh frozen plasma (as needed) to reverse the effects of potential anticoagulants
* Patient was advised to return to the hospital for follow-up and to report any changes in neurologic status or worsening symptoms

**Follow-up Instructions:**

* Patient is to follow up with the neurology clinic on April 1, 2023, for further evaluation and management
* Patient is to continue to monitor blood pressure and report any changes to the healthcare provider
* Patient is to report any worsening neurologic symptoms or seizures to the healthcare provider immediately
