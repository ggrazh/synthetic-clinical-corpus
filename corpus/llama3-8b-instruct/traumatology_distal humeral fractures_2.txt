**Radiographic Evaluation:**

* Repeat radiographs on March 17, 2023, confirmed the diagnosis of a displaced posteriorly distal humeral fracture.
* A complete neurovascular examination was performed, which revealed normal motor and sensory function in the median, radial, and ulnar nerves, and equality of distal pulses compared to the opposite limb.

**Surgical Intervention:**

* On March 20, 2023, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of the distal humeral fracture performed by an orthopedic surgeon.
* The surgery involved reduction of the fracture and internal fixation with a plate and screws.
