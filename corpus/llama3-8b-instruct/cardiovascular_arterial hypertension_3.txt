**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information**

 Patient Name: John Doe
 Date of Birth: January 10, 1975
 Date of Admission: March 15, 2023
 Date of Discharge: March 25, 2023
 Admitting Diagnosis: Arterial Hypertension

**Medical History**

John Doe, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on March 15, 2023, with a primary complaint of hypertension. He reported a history of hypertension for the past 5 years, with symptoms of headaches, fatigue, and nosebleeds. He had been taking an over-the-counter diuretic for blood pressure control, but his blood pressure remained uncontrolled. The patient had a family history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes.

**Physical Examination**

On admission, the patient's vital signs were: blood pressure 160/100 mmHg, pulse 80 beats per minute, and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. His weight was 190 pounds, and his height was 5 feet 9 inches. He had a normal physical examination, with no signs of target organ damage.

**Diagnostic Testing**

Blood pressure measurements were taken using a sphygmomanometer, with an average of 3 measurements taken at different times under specific conditions. The patient's blood pressure was measured in both arms initially, with the arm with the higher reading used for subsequent measurements. A properly sized BP cuff was used, covering two-thirds of the biceps and encircling more than 80% of the arm. The patient's blood pressure was re-checked using home blood pressure monitoring, which confirmed the diagnosis of hypertension.

**Diagnostic Findings**

The patient's urinalysis was normal, with no proteinuria or hematuria. His lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol (240 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (160 mg/dL). His metabolic panel was normal, with no evidence of kidney dysfunction. His fasting plasma glucose was 120 mg/dL. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a normal sinus rhythm with no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy.

**Treatment**

The patient was started on a treatment regimen for arterial hypertension, aiming for a blood pressure goal of < 130/80 mmHg. He was prescribed lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily, with adjustments based on blood pressure response. The patient was also instructed to increase his physical activity, lose weight, follow a healthy diet, reduce sodium intake to < 1500 mg/day, and quit smoking.

**Medications**

* Lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily
* Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally once daily (added on day 3 of admission)

**Progress and Outcomes**

The patient's blood pressure responded well to treatment, with a significant reduction in blood pressure from 160/100 mmHg to 140/90 mmHg by the end of his hospital stay. He showed no signs of target organ damage or symptoms of related diseases.

**Discharge Instructions**

The patient was discharged on March 25, 2023, with instructions to continue his treatment regimen, including taking his medications as prescribed and monitoring his blood pressure at home. He was also advised to follow up with his primary care physician in 1 week to re-evaluate his blood pressure and medication effectiveness. The patient was counseled on the importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle modifications for effective management of hypertension.

**Follow-up**

The patient will be seen in follow-up in 1 week to re-evaluate his blood pressure and medication effectiveness. He will also be instructed on how to monitor his blood pressure at home, recognize symptoms of potential complications, and understand the long-term nature of hypertension management.
