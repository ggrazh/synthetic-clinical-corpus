**Chief Complaint:**

John Smith, a 33-year-old male, was admitted to the infectious diseases unit on February 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of fever, cough, and body aches, which started on February 5, 2023. He presented with a temperature of 102.5°F (39.1°C), tachycardia, and hypoxemia, requiring oxygen supplementation.

**Medical History:**

John has no significant medical history, except for a mild asthma diagnosis, which is well-controlled with inhalers. He has never received immunizations against influenza.

**Admission and Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, John was assessed for severe respiratory symptoms, and a chest x-ray was performed to rule out pneumonia. The results showed interstitial infiltrates, consistent with primary influenza pneumonia. He was started on pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturation. A rapid antigen test was performed, which was negative, and an RT-PCR test was ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

The results of the RT-PCR test, performed on February 11, 2023, confirmed the presence of influenza A (H3N2) virus. John was diagnosed with influenza A (H3N2) pneumonia, and antiviral therapy was initiated.

**Treatment:**

John was treated with Oseltamivir, 75 mg orally twice a day, starting on February 12, 2023. He was also prescribed antipyretics and antihistamines to manage his symptoms. Zanamivir was not considered due to his history of mild asthma.

**Laboratory Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): Normal
* Blood Chemistry: Normal
* Influenza RT-PCR: Positive for influenza A (H3N2) virus
* Chest x-ray: Interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia
