The patient was started on antiviral therapy with oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

**Discharge Instructions:**

Upon discharge, Emily Wilson was advised to continue taking oseltamivir for the remainder of the 5-day treatment course.
