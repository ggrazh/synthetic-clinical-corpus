**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1995
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 20, 2023
* Discharge Diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

**Medical History:**

John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and blurry vision. He reported a 2-week history of polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. His family history was positive for type 1 diabetes in his mother and sister.

**Initial Evaluation and Diagnosis:**

Upon admission, John underwent a thorough physical examination, laboratory tests, and medical imaging studies. His initial laboratory results revealed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 350 mg/dL (19.4 mmol/L) and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level of 12.1%. These values were consistent with a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) was not performed due to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

**Treatment and Management:**

John was started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen, using a long-acting insulin analog (insulin glargine) at a dose of 0.4 units/kg/day, administered once daily at bedtime, and a rapid-acting insulin analog (insulin aspart) at a dose of 0.3 units/kg/dose, administered before meals (3 times daily). His insulin doses were adjusted based on his blood glucose levels, which were monitored frequently throughout the day.

In addition to insulin therapy, John was prescribed metformin, 500 mg twice daily, as a secondary agent to help improve his glycemic control. He was also advised to follow a individualized dietary plan, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, and to engage in regular physical activity, such as walking or cycling, for at least 150 minutes per week.

**Complications and Monitoring:**

During his hospital stay, John developed mild hypoglycemia, which was promptly treated with oral glucose gel. He also developed a mild case of ketoacidosis, which was managed with intravenous fluids and electrolyte replacement.

John underwent a funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist on March 15, 2023, which revealed no signs of diabetic retinopathy. His blood pressure was monitored regularly, and it was found to be within normal limits.

**Education and Discharge Instructions:**

John was educated on the management of his type 1 diabetes, including the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring, insulin administration, and dietary adherence. He was also advised to perform self-monitoring of blood glucose levels at home and to adjust his insulin doses accordingly. He was instructed to return to the endocrinology clinic for follow-up appointments and to contact his healthcare provider if he experienced any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

**Discharge Medications:**

* Insulin glargine: 0.4 units/kg/day, once daily at bedtime
* Insulin aspart: 0.3 units/kg/dose, before meals (3 times daily)
* Metformin: 500 mg twice daily

**Discharge Instructions:**

1. Continue to follow a individualized dietary plan, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates.
2. Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking or cycling, for at least 150 minutes per week.
3. Monitor blood glucose levels at home and adjust insulin doses accordingly.
4. Return to the endocrinology clinic for follow-up appointments.
5. Contact your healthcare provider if you experience any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

**Follow-up Care:**

John was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the endocrinology clinic on April 10, 2023, to monitor his glycemic control and adjust his treatment plan as necessary.
