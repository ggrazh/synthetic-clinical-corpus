**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Patient Name: Emily J. Smith
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1985
* Medical Record Number: 123456

**Admission Information:**

* Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
* Time of Admission: 10:45 PM
* Unit: Traumatology

**Chief Complaint:**

Emily J. Smith, a 38-year-old female, was admitted to the traumatology unit with a complaint of severe ankle pain and swelling after a fall from a height of approximately 6 feet.

**Medical History:**

Emily has no significant medical history, with the exception of a previous episode of ankle sprain in 2010.

**Physical Examination:**

Upon physical examination, Emily was found to have a swollen and tender ankle, with difficulty bearing weight. Ankle x-rays were taken in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique (mortise) views, which revealed a displaced fracture of the medial malleolus and a minimally displaced fracture of the lateral malleolus. The Ottawa ankle rules were applied, and an ankle x-ray was deemed necessary due to ankle pain and inability to bear weight without assistance immediately after the injury.

**Laboratory Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): Normal
* Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): 15 mg/dL
* Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL
* Electrolyte Panel: Within normal limits

**Imaging Studies:**

* Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique (mortise) ankle x-rays: Revealed a displaced fracture of the medial malleolus and a minimally displaced fracture of the lateral malleolus.
* External rotation stress x-ray: Detected tibiotalar subluxation, suggesting deltoid ligament and ankle joint instability.

**Diagnosis:**

Emily was diagnosed with a displaced fracture of the medial malleolus and a minimally displaced fracture of the lateral malleolus, consistent with an unstable ankle fracture.

**Treatment:**

* Pain management: Morphine 15 mg IV every 4 hours as needed, and acetaminophen 500 mg orally every 6 hours as needed.
* Antibiotics: Cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days to prevent infection.
* Ankle immobilization: A walking boot was applied to immobilize the ankle and maintain alignment.
* Follow-up: Emily was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the orthopedic surgeon on March 24, 2023, to assess the healing progress and plan for further treatment.

**Hospital Course:**

Emily's hospital course was marked by moderate to severe pain, which was managed effectively with pain medication. She was able to bear weight with assistance and was able to ambulate with a walker. On March 12, 2023, Emily underwent an external rotation stress x-ray, which revealed tibiotalar subluxation, suggesting deltoid ligament and ankle joint instability. On March 14, 2023, Emily underwent a follow-up examination, which revealed a stable ankle with minimal swelling and pain.

**Discharge Instructions:**

Emily was discharged from the hospital on March 15, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Continue to use the walking boot for 6 weeks to maintain ankle alignment and prevent further injury.
* Take acetaminophen 500 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for pain management.
* Take cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days to prevent infection.
* Follow up with the orthopedic surgeon on March 24, 2023, to assess the healing progress and plan for further treatment.
* Avoid putting weight on the affected ankle for 6 weeks, except for showering and using the bathroom.

**Prognosis:**

The prognosis for Emily's ankle fracture is good, assuming the ankle remains stable and treatment results in correct alignment. However, incorrect alignment can lead to arthritis and recurrent fractures.

**Special Instructions:**

Emily was advised to follow up with the orthopedic surgeon in 6 weeks to assess the healing progress and plan for further treatment. She was also advised to avoid participating in high-impact activities, such as running or jumping, for at least 6 months to prevent further injury.
