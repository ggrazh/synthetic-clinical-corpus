**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1980
* Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
* Date of Discharge: March 25, 2023

**Clinical Summary:**

John Doe, a 43-year-old male, was admitted to our hospital's traumatology unit on March 10, 2023, following a high-energy ankle injury sustained during a fall from a height. He presented to the emergency department with severe ankle pain, swelling, and bruising.

**Initial Assessment and Diagnosis:**

Upon initial evaluation, John was unable to bear weight without assistance and exhibited significant ankle pain with weight-bearing. Ankle x-rays were taken in anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique (mortise) views, which revealed a comminuted fracture of the medial and lateral malleoli. The Ottawa ankle rules were applied, and given the patient's age and inability to bear weight without assistance, an ankle x-ray was required.

**Investigations and Findings:**

Further evaluation revealed a displaced fracture of the medial malleolus, with an open mortise on the medial side. An external rotation stress x-ray was performed, which detected tibiotalar subluxation. Peroneal nerve function was tested, and the patient was found to have normal dorsiflexion at the ankle. Knee x-rays were taken, which revealed an associated proximal fibula fracture, consistent with a Maisonneuve fracture.

**Medical Treatment:**

John was initially managed with a splint and crutches to immobilize the ankle and reduce pain. He was started on a regimen of pain medications, including acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed, and ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hours as needed. He was also prescribed a antibiotic, cephalexin 500mg every 12 hours for 7 days, to prevent infection.

**Surgical Intervention:**

Due to the unstable nature of the ankle fracture, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) was performed on March 15, 2023. The procedure involved reduction of the fracture fragments and stabilization using a plate and screws. The patient tolerated the procedure well and was discharged to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring.

**Postoperative Course:**

Postoperatively, John was placed in a non-weight-bearing cast for 6 weeks to allow for adequate healing. He was instructed to use crutches for mobility and to maintain a strict elevation program to reduce swelling. He was also prescribed physical therapy to maintain range of motion and strength in the ankle.

**Discharge Instructions:**

At the time of discharge, John was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in 2 weeks to assess wound healing and to remove the cast. He was also instructed to continue with physical therapy and to follow up with the traumatology unit in 6 weeks to assess fracture healing.

**Prognosis:**

The prognosis for ankle fractures is generally good if the ankle is stable and treatment results in correct alignment. However, incorrect alignment can lead to arthritis and recurrent fractures. Given the nature of John's injury and treatment, the prognosis is excellent, and he is expected to make a full recovery with proper follow-up and care.

**Medications:**

* Acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed
* Ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hours as needed
* Cephalexin 500mg every 12 hours for 7 days

**Follow-up Appointments:**

* Primary care physician follow-up: 2 weeks post-discharge
* Traumatology unit follow-up: 6 weeks post-discharge

**Discharge Medications:**

* Acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed
* Ibuprofen 400mg every 8 hours as needed

**Discharge Instructions:**

* Follow up with primary care physician in 2 weeks
* Continue with physical therapy
* Follow up with traumatology unit in 6 weeks
* Maintain strict elevation program to reduce swelling
