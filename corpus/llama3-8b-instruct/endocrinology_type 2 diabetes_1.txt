**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: January 12, 1985
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 25, 2023
* Room Number: 304, Endocrinology Unit

**Chief Complaint:**

Jane Doe, a 38-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit with symptoms of increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. She was referred to the unit from her primary care physician after a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was suspected based on a random glucose value of 220 mg/dL.

**Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, Jane's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, heart rate of 70 beats per minute, and body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/mÂ². A thorough physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities. Laboratory tests, including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), were ordered to confirm the diagnosis.

On March 12, 2023, Jane's FPG level was 240 mg/dL, and her HbA1C level was 7.2%. These results confirmed the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. She was started on metformin 500 mg twice daily and instructed on a diet plan emphasizing whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and portion control.

On March 15, 2023, Jane's HbA1C level was rechecked, and it had decreased to 6.8%. She was also started on a regimen of regular physical activity, including 30 minutes of brisk walking, three times a week.

On March 20, 2023, Jane's blood glucose levels were monitored, and it was noted that she was experiencing frequent hypoglycemic episodes. Her insulin dose was adjusted to 10 units of insulin glargine at bedtime, and she was instructed to monitor her blood glucose levels more frequently.

**Discharge Instructions:**

Jane was discharged from the hospital on March 25, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Continue taking metformin 500 mg twice daily
* Monitor blood glucose levels at least four times a day
