**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1990
* Gender: Male
* Admitting Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 17, 2023

**Chief Complaint and Medical History:**

John Doe, a 33-year-old male, was admitted to the infectious diseases unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of severe fatigue, fever, and cough. He had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which he was taking metoprolol 25 mg twice a day and atorvastatin 20 mg once a day, respectively. He had no known allergies and had not received any vaccinations in the past year.

**Clinical Course:**

Upon admission, John was found to have a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, and pulse rate of 100 beats per minute. His respiratory rate was 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 92% on room air. He had bilateral wheezing on auscultation. A rapid antigen test for influenza was performed, which was negative. However, given the high likelihood of influenza in the community, we decided to proceed with further testing.

On March 12, 2023, a nasopharyngeal swab was collected for RT-PCR testing, which later confirmed the diagnosis of influenza A (H3N2) subtype. The patient was started on symptomatic treatment, including rest, hydration, and antipyretics. His fever was managed with acetaminophen 325 mg every 4 hours as needed.

**Laboratory Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): WBC count 12,000 cells/μL, Hb 13.5 g/dL, and platelet count 250,000 cells/μL.
* Electrolyte panel: Na 140 mmol/L, K 4.2 mmol/L, and creatinine 0.8 mg/dL.
* Chest X-ray: Mild bilateral interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia.

**Treatment:**

On March 14, 2023, the patient was started on oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, given his age and the severity of his symptoms. He was also given pulmicort 200 mcg twice a day for prophylaxis against bronchospasm. His cough and fever improved significantly within 24 hours of starting antiviral treatment.

**Complications and Interventions:**

The patient developed mild bronchospasm on March 15, 2023, which was managed with albuterol 2.5 mg every 4 hours as needed. He also received oxygen supplementation via nasal prongs at 2 liters per minute to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

**Discharge Instructions:**

John Doe was discharged from the hospital on March 17, 2023, with a prescription for oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for the next 5 days. He was advised to continue taking pulmicort 200 mcg twice a day for the next 7 days. He was also instructed to rest, stay hydrated, and use acetaminophen 325 mg every 4 hours as needed for fever management. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with his primary care physician on March 24, 2023, and March 31, 2023.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was diagnosed with influenza A (H3N2) subtype and was treated with oseltamivir, pulmicort, and symptomatic treatment. His condition improved significantly with antiviral therapy, and he was discharged from the hospital without any complications. He will require close follow-up to ensure resolution of his symptoms and prevent any potential complications.
