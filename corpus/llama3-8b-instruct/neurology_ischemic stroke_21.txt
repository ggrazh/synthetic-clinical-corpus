**Clinical Course:**

Upon admission, the patient was evaluated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which revealed a score of 14, indicating a moderate severity of stroke. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head was performed, which showed no signs of hemorrhage, and a diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained, revealing a large ischemic stroke affecting the left middle cerebral artery territory. The patient's bedside glucose was found to be 120 mg/dL.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

A comprehensive diagnostic workup was performed, which included:

* Complete blood count (CBC): within normal limits
* Metabolic panel: within normal limits
* Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT): within normal limits
* Fasting glucose: 120 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin A1C: 7.2%
* Lipid profile: total cholesterol 200 mg/dL, HDL 40 mg/dL, LDL 120 mg/dL, triglycerides 150 mg/dL
* Electrocardiogram (ECG): normal sinus rhythm
* Telemetry: no arrhythmias
* Serum troponin: 0.05 ng/mL (normal)
* Echocardiography: normal left ventricular function
* MRA: normal intracranial and extracranial vasculature
* CTA: normal carotid and vertebral arteries
* Duplex ultrasonography: normal carotid and vertebral arteries

**Acute Treatment:**

The patient received the following acute treatment:

* IV antihypertensives: labetalol 10 mg IV every 15 minutes as needed, with a maximum dose of 40 mg
* Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA): 0.9 mg/kg IV, given over 60 minutes, with 10% given as a rapid IV injection
* Antiplatelet therapy: aspirin 325 mg orally every 24 hours
* Mechanical thrombectomy: not performed

**Hospital Course:**

The patient's hospital course was marked by a gradual improvement in symptoms, with the NIHSS score decreasing to 8 by day 3. The patient was started on a rehabilitation program on day 5, which included physical, occupational, and speech therapy.

**Discharge Medications:**

The patient was discharged on the following medications:

* Aspirin 81 mg orally every 24 hours
* Clopidogrel 75 mg orally every 24 hours
* Metoprolol 25 mg orally every 12 hours
* Warfarin 5 mg orally every 24 hours, with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) target of 2-3

**Instructions:**

The patient was instructed to:

* Take all medications as directed
* Attend follow-up appointments with the neurologist and primary care physician
* Follow a low-sodium diet
* Engage in regular physical activity
* Monitor blood pressure and report any changes to the healthcare provider

**Follow-up:**

The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointments with the neurologist and primary care physician in 1 week, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks post-discharge.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was admitted to the neurology unit with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, which was confirmed by neuroimaging and bedside glucose testing. The patient received acute treatment with IV antihypertensives, tPA, and antiplatelet therapy, and was discharged on a regimen of aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, and warfarin. The patient is expected to make a good recovery with follow-up and adherence to the discharge instructions.
