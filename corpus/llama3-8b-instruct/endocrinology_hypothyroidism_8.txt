Upon admission, Emily underwent a comprehensive laboratory evaluation, including thyroid function tests. Her initial TSH level was 30.5 mIU/L, and free T4 level was 0.8 ng/dL, consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Her complete blood count (CBC) revealed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL. Her serum cholesterol level was 250 mg/dL.

**Hospital Course:**

Emily was started on levothyroxine therapy at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, adjusted every 6 weeks to achieve her individualized maintenance dose. She was also prescribed a calcium and vitamin D supplement to address her secondary hyperparathyroidism.

On March 17, 2023, Emily's TSH level decreased to 20.2 mIU/L, and her free T4 level increased to 1.2 ng/dL, indicating a response to levothyroxine therapy. Her CBC showed a slight improvement in her anemia, with a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL.

**Medications:**

* Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day
* Calcium carbonate 500 mg orally three times a day
