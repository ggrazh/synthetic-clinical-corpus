**Admission and Clinical Course:**

John Doe, a 32-year-old male, was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit on February 10, 2023, with symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue for 3 days. He presented to the emergency department with a temperature of 102°F (39°C), blood oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and a respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. His medical history was significant for asthma, for which he was taking inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators. He had no significant travel history or exposure to individuals with influenza-like illness.

Upon admission, the patient was started on pulse oximetry and chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia. The chest x-ray revealed interstitial infiltrates, consistent with primary influenza pneumonia. The patient was also tested for influenza using rapid antigen testing and RT-PCR. The results were positive for influenza A (H3N2) virus, which was further confirmed by RT-PCR.

**Diagnostic Workup and Treatment:**

The patient was treated symptomatically with antipyretics, hydration, and rest. He was also started on antiviral therapy with Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, which was adjusted based on his weight and age. The patient was closely monitored for signs of worsening respiratory status, and oxygen therapy was initiated as needed.

**Laboratory Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): normal white blood cell count, mild neutropenia
* Blood biochemistry: normal electrolyte levels, mild elevation in creatinine
* Influenza testing: positive for influenza A (H3N2) virus by rapid antigen testing and RT-PCR
