**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
* Date of Discharge: March 20, 2023
* Age: 65 years
* Sex: Male
* Chief Complaint: Left-sided weakness and speech difficulty

**Admission and Initial Evaluation:**

John Doe was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of left-sided weakness and speech difficulty. He reported a sudden onset of symptoms approximately 2 hours prior to admission. The patient's National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 18, indicating a severe ischemic stroke. Neuroimaging with CT scan revealed a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct, consistent with ischemic stroke.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

* Neuroimaging: CT and diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) scans confirmed the diagnosis of ischemic stroke with a left MCA territory infarct.
* Cardiac evaluation: ECG and telemetry monitoring revealed no acute coronary syndrome, while serum troponin levels were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed no evidence of cardiac valvular disease.
* Vascular imaging: MRA and CTA scans revealed significant stenosis of the left internal carotid artery (ICA).
* Blood tests: Complete blood count (CBC), metabolic panel, prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile were within normal limits.
* Bedside glucose testing: Blood glucose levels were 120 mg/dL.

**Acute Treatment:**

* IV antihypertensives: Labetalol 10 mg/hour was administered to control blood pressure, which was initially 220/110 mmHg.
* Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA): 0.9 mg/kg IV (maximum 90 mg) was administered, with 10% given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes. Brain hemorrhage was excluded by CT scan, and blood pressure was controlled prior to administration.
* Antiplatelet therapy: Aspirin 325 mg was administered within 48 hours of stroke onset.
* Mechanical thrombectomy: Due to the presence of significant stenosis of the left ICA, mechanical thrombectomy was not performed.

**Hospital Course:**

The patient's clinical condition improved gradually, with resolution of left-sided weakness and speech difficulty. He was weaned off mechanical ventilation on March 15, 2023, and transferred to a rehabilitation unit for further management.

**Discharge Medications:**

* Aspirin 81 mg daily
* Clopidogrel 75 mg daily (dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days)
* Metoprolol 50 mg daily (for blood pressure control)
* Warfarin 5 mg daily (targeting an INR of 2 to 3 for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, which was diagnosed on March 18, 2023)

**Discharge Instructions:**

* Follow-up appointment with the neurologist in 1 week
* Continue dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days
* Monitor for signs of bleeding or bruising
* Adhere to a strict anticoagulation protocol
* Engage in rehabilitation therapy to maintain and improve functional abilities

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was diagnosed with an ischemic stroke due to left ICA stenosis and received acute treatment with IV antihypertensives, tPA, and antiplatelet therapy. He was stabilized and discharged to a rehabilitation unit for further management. Continued follow-up and management will be necessary to control blood pressure, prevent recurrent stroke, and optimize long-term outcomes.
