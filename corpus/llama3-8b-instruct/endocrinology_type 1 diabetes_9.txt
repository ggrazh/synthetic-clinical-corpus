His initial insulin dose was adjusted based on his FPG and postprandial glucose levels. He was also prescribed metformin 500 mg orally twice daily for glucose control.

**Dietary and Lifestyle Recommendations**

John was educated on a personalized diet plan, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. He was advised to aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, with adjustments made to his insulin dose and carbohydrate intake as needed to manage hypoglycemia risk during exercise.
