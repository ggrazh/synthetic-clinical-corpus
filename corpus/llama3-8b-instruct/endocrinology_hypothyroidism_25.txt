**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: January 1, 1980
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 22, 2023

**Medical History:**

Jane Doe, a 43-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Her medical history included hypertension, which was well-controlled with medication. She had no significant family history of thyroid disorders.

**Physical Examination:**

Upon admission, Jane was found to be afebrile, with a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse rate of 60 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her physical examination revealed a moderately obese female with a diffuse goiter.

**Laboratory Results:**

Initial laboratory results showed a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 30.5 μIU/mL (normal range: 0.4-4.0 μIU/mL), and a free thyroxine (T4) level of 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). These results were consistent with primary hypothyroidism.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**

Further evaluation included a complete blood count, which revealed a mild normocytic-normochromic anemia. Her serum cholesterol level was found to be elevated at 240 mg/dL. A 24-hour thyroid hormone profile showed low levels of free T4 and normal levels of triiodothyronine (T3).

**Treatment:**

Based on the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, Jane was started on levothyroxine therapy. The initial dose was 100 mcg orally once a day, which was titrated to 125 mcg orally once a day after 6 weeks to achieve a euthyroid state.

**Course of Hospitalization:**

During her hospital stay, Jane was monitored closely for signs of thyroid hormone replacement, including changes in her cardiac status, temperature, and blood pressure. Her anemia was managed with iron supplements, and her serum cholesterol level was closely followed. She was also counseled on the importance of regular follow-up appointments and thyroid hormone monitoring.

**Discharge Instructions:**

At the time of discharge on March 22, 2023, Jane was advised to continue taking levothyroxine 125 mcg orally once a day. She was also instructed to return for a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to reassess her thyroid hormone levels and adjust her medication as needed. Additionally, she was advised to report any changes in her symptoms, such as increased fatigue or weight gain, to her primary care physician.

**Special Instructions:**

In the event of a thyroid emergency, such as myxedema coma, Jane was instructed to seek immediate medical attention. She was also advised to avoid taking other medications that may interfere with levothyroxine absorption, such as cholestyramine, aluminum hydroxide, or iron salts.

**Follow-up Care:**

Jane was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with the endocrinology department on April 26, 2023, to reassess her thyroid hormone levels and adjust her medication as needed. She was also advised to schedule regular follow-up appointments with her primary care physician to monitor her overall health and adjust her medication regimen as necessary.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and treated with levothyroxine therapy. She was closely monitored during her hospital stay and discharged with instructions for follow-up care. Her prognosis is excellent with continued therapy and regular monitoring.
