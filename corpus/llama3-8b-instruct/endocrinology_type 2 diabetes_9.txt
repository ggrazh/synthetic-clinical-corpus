**Hospital Course:**

John Smith, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 15, 2023, with a chief complaint of increasing thirst and urination over the past month. He had a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but no significant family history of diabetes. On physical examination, he was observed to have mild pedal edema and a non-tender abdomen.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

Initial laboratory tests revealed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 250 mg/dL, which was confirmed by a repeat test. Additionally, his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was found to be 8.2%. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

**Treatment:**

The patient was started on a diet and exercise regimen, with a goal of reducing his body mass index (BMI) and improving his glucose control. He was also initiated on metformin 500 mg twice daily, which was titrated up to 1000 mg twice daily based on his glucose levels.

In addition, he was prescribed a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, for weight loss and glucose control. His blood glucose levels were monitored regularly, and his insulin doses were adjusted accordingly.

**Complications:**

The patient developed mild hyperglycemia during his hospital stay, which was managed with insulin therapy. He also had a mild episode of hypoglycemia, which was treated with oral glucose.

**Education:**

The patient was educated on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring. He was also instructed on how to adjust his insulin doses based on his blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake.

**Discharge Instructions:**

The patient was discharged on a regimen of metformin 1000 mg twice daily, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, and a diet that focuses on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. He was instructed to monitor his blood glucose levels regularly and to adjust his insulin doses accordingly.

**Follow-up:**

The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and endocrinologist every 3-4 months to monitor his blood glucose levels and adjust his treatment regimen as needed.

**Additional Recommendations:**

The patient was recommended to engage in regular physical activity, such as at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, in addition to strength-training exercises at least two times per week.

He was also recommended to get vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2.

**Conclusion:**

John Smith was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and was treated with a diet and exercise regimen, metformin, and a GLP-1 receptor agonist. He was educated on the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring and how to adjust his insulin doses based on his blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake. He was discharged on a regimen of metformin and semaglutide, and was scheduled for follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and endocrinologist.
