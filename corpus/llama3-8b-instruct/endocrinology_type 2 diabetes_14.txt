**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Patient Name: Jane Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1980
* Admit Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 20, 2023
* Primary Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes

**Medical History:**

Jane Doe, a 43-year-old female, was admitted to our endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of increased thirst and urination, fatigue, and blurred vision. She had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Her physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, body mass index (BMI) of 32.5 kg/mÂ², and bilateral pedal edema. Initial laboratory results showed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 220 mg/dL (> 11.1 mmol/L) and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level of 9.5% (indicating diabetes).

**Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, Jane was started on a standardized diabetes treatment regimen, including a diet focused on whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and individualized caloric intake. She was also prescribed metformin 1000 mg twice daily and instructed on proper foot care and monitoring for diabetic complications. Her HbA1C level was rechecked on March 15, 2023, and was found to be 8.2%, indicating improvement in glucose control.

On March 17, 2023, Jane's FPG level was rechecked and was found to be 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L), indicating good glycemic control. Her blood pressure was also well-controlled, with a reading of 130/80 mmHg.

**Medications:**

* Metformin 1000 mg twice daily
* Insulin (as needed) for blood glucose control

**Treatment Plan:**

Jane was discharged with a comprehensive treatment plan, including:

* Diet: Continue a diet focused on whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and individualized caloric intake
* Exercise: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, with adjustments for hypoglycemia risk
* Medications: Continue metformin 1000 mg twice daily, with insulin therapy initiated as needed for blood glucose control
* Monitoring: Monitor blood glucose levels regularly and adjust insulin doses based on carbohydrate intake and glucose levels
* Education: Continue patient education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications

**Follow-up:**

Jane is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with her primary care physician in one week to monitor her progress and adjust her treatment plan as needed. She will also be seen in our endocrinology clinic in three months for a comprehensive diabetes management visit.

**Recommendations:**

* Regular professional podiatric care is recommended to monitor for diabetic complications such as foot ulcers and peripheral neuropathy
* Vaccination against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 is recommended
* Consideration should be given to medical devices or surgical treatments for obesity, such as sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass, for patients with significant weight-related comorbidities.

**Discharge Instruction:**

* Take metformin 1000 mg twice daily as directed
* Monitor blood glucose levels regularly and adjust insulin doses based on carbohydrate intake and glucose levels
* Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week
* Continue diet focused on whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and individualized caloric intake
* Attend follow-up appointments as scheduled
