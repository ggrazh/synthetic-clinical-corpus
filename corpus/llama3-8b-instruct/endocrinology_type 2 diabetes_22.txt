John Doe, a 43-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of increased thirst and urination over the past few weeks.

**Hospital Course:**

Upon admission, John's fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 210 mg/dL, which was confirmed by a repeat test the following day. His glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was 8.2%. Given his symptoms and laboratory results, John was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

John was initiated on metformin 500 mg twice daily, which was titrated to 1000 mg twice daily based on his HbA1C levels. He was also prescribed a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, for weight loss and glycemic control.

**Dietary and Lifestyle Recommendations:**

John was educated on the importance of a balanced diet and regular physical activity. He was advised to focus on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, and to individualize his dietary plan based on his comorbid conditions. He was also instructed to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, with adjustments for hypoglycemia risk.
