**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1955
* Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
* Date of Discharge: March 20, 2023
* Room Number: 314, Neurology Unit

**Admission and Initial Evaluation:**

John Doe, a 68-year-old male, was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, with a sudden onset of severe headache, left-sided weakness, and impaired consciousness. He was found to have a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12, with evidence of left hemiparesis. His medical history revealed hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of smoking. He was taking metoprolol 50 mg twice daily, aspirin 81 mg daily, and simvastatin 40 mg daily.

**Initial Diagnostic Workup:**

Upon admission, blood glucose levels were measured at the bedside, revealing a value of 120 mg/dL. A complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies (INR, PTT, platelet count) were performed, which showed normal results. An immediate CT scan of the head was performed, revealing a large intracerebral hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter. The patient was subsequently transferred to the neurointensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.

**Management and Treatment:**

The patient was treated with nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV initially, increased by 2.5 mg/hour every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed, to control hypertension. His systolic blood pressure was maintained between 140-160 mm Hg to avoid high blood pressure peaks and variability. Blood glucose levels were monitored closely, and insulin therapy was initiated as needed to maintain a target range of 80-150 mg/dL.

The patient was also administered fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrate, and vitamin K to reverse the effects of his anticoagulant medications. Idarucizumab was not needed as he was not taking dabigatran. He was closely monitored for signs of bleeding, and no evidence of ongoing bleeding was observed.

**Neuroimaging and Surgical Intervention:**

CT angiography showed areas where contrast extravasated into the clot, indicating ongoing bleeding and suggesting poor outcome. The patient's neuroimaging results also showed signs of midline shift and herniation, warranting surgical evacuation of the hematoma. He underwent surgical evacuation of the left frontal lobe hematoma on March 15, 2023, which was successful in reducing the size of the hematoma and alleviating symptoms.

**Complications and Course:**

The patient developed hydrocephalus post-operatively, which was managed with placement of an external ventricular drain to rapidly decrease intracranial pressure. He also experienced a single seizure episode, which was managed with levetiracetam 500 mg IV every 12 hours. He did not require anticonvulsant prophylaxis.

**Discharge Summary:**

John Doe was discharged from the hospital on March 20, 2023, with significant improvement in his neurologic function. His Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score had improved to 15, and his left hemiparesis had resolved. He was advised to continue with his antihypertensive medications and to follow up with his primary care physician for further management of his hypertension.

**Medications:**

* Nicardipine 2.5 mg/hour IV initially, increased by 2.5 mg/hour every 5 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed
* Levetiracetam 500 mg IV every 12 hours
* Fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrate, and vitamin K as needed
* Idarucizumab not administered
* Antiseizure medications not prophylactically used

**Follow-up:**

John Doe is scheduled to follow up with his primary care physician in one week for further evaluation and management of his hypertension. He will also be seen in the neurology clinic in two weeks for follow-up on his neurologic status.
