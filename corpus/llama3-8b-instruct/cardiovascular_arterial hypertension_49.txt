**Diagnostic Testing**

The patient underwent a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including:

* Reduced sodium intake (aiming for < 1500 mg/day)
* Smoking cessation
* Home blood pressure monitoring using a calibrated sphygmomanometer

**Discharge Instructions**

The patient was instructed to:

* Take his medications as prescribed
* Monitor his blood pressure at home and record the readings
* Recognize symptoms of potential complications, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness
* Understand the long-term nature of hypertension management and the importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle modifications
* Schedule follow-up appointments with his primary care physician for regular reassessment of his blood pressure and medication effectiveness

**Follow-up**

The patient will be seen in follow-up in 2 weeks to reassess his blood pressure and medication effectiveness. He will also be re-evaluated for target organ damage and potential complications.
