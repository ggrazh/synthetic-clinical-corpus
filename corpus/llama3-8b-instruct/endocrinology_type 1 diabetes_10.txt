John Doe, a 33-year-old male, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on February 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of persistent thirst, frequent urination, and blurred vision. He reported a 2-week history of these symptoms, which had been worsening over the past week. His medical history was significant for a family history of type 1 diabetes in his mother and a recent diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis 6 weeks prior to admission.

* Random Plasma Glucose: 450 mg/dL (25.0 mmol/L)

**Hospital Course**

Upon admission, John was started on a sliding-scale insulin regimen to control blood glucose levels. He underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) on February 11, 2023, which confirmed the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A thorough physical examination revealed no signs of diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hyperglycemia-related complications.

**Medical Management**

During his hospital stay, John received insulin therapy, including a basal-bolus regimen consisting of:

* Lantus (insulin glargine) 20 units subcutaneously at 12:00 AM and 8:00 PM

He also received metformin 500mg orally twice daily for glycemic control. His blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and adjustments were made to his insulin regimen as needed.

**Education and Lifestyle Modifications**

John received comprehensive education on diabetes management, including diet, exercise, and medication adherence. He was counseled on the importance of monitoring his blood glucose levels, recognizing symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and managing his condition with a balanced diet and regular physical activity.

**Conclusion**

John Doe was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and received comprehensive medical and educational management during his hospital stay. He was discharged with a basal-bolus insulin regimen, metformin, and lifestyle modifications to manage his condition. Close follow-up and regular monitoring are essential for maintaining optimal glycemic control and preventing complications.
