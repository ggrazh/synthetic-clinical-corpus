Her serum triiodothyronine (T3) level was within normal limits at 2.1 ng/mL (reference range: 1.7-3.7 ng/mL). Her complete blood count (CBC) revealed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12.2 g/dL (reference range: 12.0-16.0 g/dL). Her serum cholesterol level was elevated at 250 mg/dL (reference range: 150-240 mg/dL).

**Hospital Course**

Emily was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism based on her elevated TSH level and low free T4 level. She was started on levothyroxine therapy with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once daily. Her medications were adjusted as follows:
