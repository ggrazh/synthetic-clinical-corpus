John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and fatigue. Upon admission, the patient's fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 220 mg/dL (> 11.1 mmol/L), and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) was 8.2%. The patient's medical history was significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**

During the patient's hospital stay, he underwent a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including:

* FPG and OGTT testing to confirm the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
* HbA1C testing to assess glycemic control
* Foot and funduscopic examinations to assess for diabetic complications
* Urine testing for albuminuria
* Measurement of serum creatinine and lipid profile to assess kidney and cardiovascular function

**Treatment:**

The patient was started on a multidisciplinary treatment plan, including:

* Dietary education, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates
* Exercise therapy, aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week
* Patient education on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake
* Metformin 500 mg twice daily, as the first-line oral medication for type 2 diabetes
* Semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly, as a GLP-1 receptor agonist for weight loss and glycemic control

**Medications:**

* Metformin 500 mg twice daily
* Semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly
* Aspirin 81 mg daily (for cardiovascular risk reduction)

**Follow-up:**

The patient is scheduled for follow-up appointments with Dr. Smith on April 14, 2023, and June 9, 2023, to assess glycemic control, monitor for diabetic complications, and adjust treatment as needed.

**Patient Education:**

The patient was educated on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. He was instructed to monitor for signs of hypoglycemia, including shakiness, sweating, and dizziness, and to treat with 15-20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates. He was also educated on the importance of regular physical activity, including both aerobic and resistance exercises, and to adjust insulin or carbohydrate intake before exercise to avoid hypoglycemia.
