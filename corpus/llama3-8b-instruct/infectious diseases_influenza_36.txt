**Admission and Hospital Course:**

John Doe was admitted to the infectious diseases unit on January 10, 2023, with a 3-day history of fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. He initially presented to the emergency department with a temperature of 38.5Â°C, blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. He had no significant medical history and was not taking any medications.

On admission, a rapid antigen test was performed, which was negative for influenza. However, due to the high prevalence of influenza in the community, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was ordered. The test results confirmed influenza A (H3N2) infection.

Patient's symptoms worsened over the next 24 hours, with increased fever, cough, and shortness of breath. A chest X-ray was performed, which showed interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia. Pulse oximetry revealed oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, which prompted the initiation of supplemental oxygen therapy.

**Treatment and Management:**

* Antiviral therapy with oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day was initiated on January 11, 2023, based on the patient's age and high-risk status for severe influenza.
* Symptomatic treatment included acetaminophen 325 mg orally every 8 hours for fever and cough, and hydration with intravenous fluids to maintain adequate fluid status.
* Bronchodilators were not necessary, as the patient did not have a history of reactive airway disease.
* Antibacterial therapy was not initiated, as the patient did not have any signs of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

**Clinical Course:**

John Doe's condition improved gradually over the next 5 days, with resolution of fever, improvement in cough and shortness of breath, and normalization of oxygen saturation. He was discharged from the hospital on January 15, 2023, with a plan for continued antiviral therapy for an additional 5 days.

**Discharge Instructions:**

* Continue oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for an additional 5 days.
* Take acetaminophen 325 mg orally every 8 hours as needed for fever and cough.
* Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration.
* Monitor for signs of secondary bacterial pneumonia, such as worsening cough, fever, or chest pain.
* Follow up with primary care physician or infectious diseases specialist in 1 week to reassess for influenza resolution and any potential complications.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was diagnosed with influenza A (H3N2) infection and managed with antiviral therapy and symptomatic treatment. His condition improved over the course of his hospital stay, and he was discharged with a plan for continued antiviral therapy to prevent complications and promote recovery.
