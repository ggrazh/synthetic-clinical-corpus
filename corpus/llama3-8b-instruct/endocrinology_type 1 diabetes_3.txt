Her symptoms began suddenly, and she had not experienced any prior illnesses or infections. Her family history is significant for type 1 diabetes in her younger brother.

**Admission Diagnosis:**

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, the admitting physician suspected type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient's fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 450 mg/dL (25 mmol/L), and her glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was 14.2%. The diagnosis was confirmed with a random plasma glucose level of 350 mg/dL (19.4 mmol/L) at admission.

**Hospital Course:**

The patient was started on insulin therapy with a basal-bolus regimen, consisting of insulin glargine 100 units subcutaneously at bedtime and insulin aspart 10 units subcutaneously before meals. Her initial insulin dose was adjusted based on her blood glucose levels, which were monitored regularly. She was also prescribed metformin 500 mg orally twice daily as an oral antihyperglycemic agent.

The patient's blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and her insulin doses were adjusted accordingly. She was educated on the importance of proper injection techniques, insulin dosing, and blood glucose monitoring. She was also advised to follow a balanced diet, with a focus on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, and to engage in regular physical activity, such as walking for at least 30 minutes daily.

**Discharge Instructions:**

The patient was discharged from the hospital on February 25, 2023, with a plan for ongoing insulin therapy and oral antihyperglycemic agents. She was advised to return to the clinic for follow-up in 1 week to review her blood glucose levels and adjust her insulin doses as needed.
