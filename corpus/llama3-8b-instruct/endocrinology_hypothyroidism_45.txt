Jane was started on levothyroxine therapy at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day. Her TFTs were monitored regularly, and her medication was adjusted accordingly. She was also advised to take the medication with a glass of water and to avoid taking it with food or antacids that could decrease its absorption.
