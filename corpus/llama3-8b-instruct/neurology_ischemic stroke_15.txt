**Medical History:**

John Doe, a 68-year-old retired male, presented to the emergency department on March 10, 2023, with sudden onset of left-sided weakness, slurred speech, and difficulty walking. He reported experiencing these symptoms for approximately 2 hours before seeking medical attention. His medical history was significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking for 30 years.

**Admission and Initial Evaluation:**

Upon admission, the patient was evaluated using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), which revealed a score of 14, indicating severe stroke symptoms. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was performed, which revealed no evidence of hemorrhage. A diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was also performed, which showed evidence of acute ischemia in the left middle cerebral artery territory.

**Diagnostic Workup:**

A comprehensive diagnostic workup was performed, including:

* Complete blood count (CBC) with normal results
* Metabolic panel with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels
* Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) with normal results
* Fasting glucose level of 120 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin A1C level of 7.5%
* Lipid profile with total cholesterol level of 220 mg/dL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of 130 mg/dL
* Electrocardiogram (ECG) with normal sinus rhythm
* Serum troponin level of 0.05 ng/mL
* Echocardiogram with normal left ventricular function and no evidence of valvular disease

**Treatment:**

The patient was treated with the following medications:

* Intravenous (IV) antihypertensive agents, including nicardipine and labetalol, to maintain a blood pressure goal of < 180/100 mm Hg
* IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 0.9 mg/kg, with 10% given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes, within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
* Mechanical thrombectomy was not performed due to the patient's age and medical comorbidities
* Aspirin 325 mg orally once daily, started within 24 hours of symptom onset
* Clopidogrel 75 mg orally once daily, started within 24 hours of symptom onset

**Hospital Course:**

The patient remained in the neurology unit for 12 days, during which time he underwent physical, occupational, and speech therapy. He demonstrated significant improvement in his symptoms, with a final NIHSS score of 2. He was able to walk with minimal assistance and had improved speech and cognitive function.

**Discharge Instructions:**

The patient was discharged home on March 22, 2023, with the following instructions:

* Take aspirin 81-325 mg orally once daily for the next 30 days
* Take clopidogrel 75 mg orally once daily for the next 21 days
* Take warfarin 5 mg orally once daily to target an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2-3 for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation
* Attend follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and neurologist as scheduled
* Continue to follow a heart-healthy diet and manage his blood pressure and cholesterol levels

**Follow-up Plan:**

The patient is scheduled to follow up with his primary care physician in one week and with his neurologist in two weeks. He will also undergo a repeat CT scan of the brain in six months to assess for any residual effects of the stroke.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was admitted to the hospital with a severe ischemic stroke and was treated with IV tPA and aspirin. He demonstrated significant improvement in his symptoms and was discharged home with a plan for continued treatment and follow-up.
