**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: March 12, 1955
* Address: 123 Main St, Anytown, USA
* Insurance: Medicare

**Admission Information:**

* Date of Admission: March 10, 2023
* Unit: Neurology
* Chief Complaint: Sudden onset of left-sided weakness and speech difficulty

**Medical History:**

* Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking history
* Previous diagnosis of atrial fibrillation

**Admission Diagnosis:**

* Ischemic stroke, confirmed by diffusion-weighted MRI and CT scans
* NIHSS score: 15 (high severity)

**Treatment and Management:**

* IV antihypertensives (labetalol and nicardipine) to control blood pressure
* IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administered at 0.9 mg/kg (maximum 90 mg) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
* Mechanical thrombectomy attempted but unsuccessful due to large vessel occlusion
* Aspirin 325 mg administered within 48 hours of stroke onset
* Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel 75 mg administered within 24 hours of symptom onset for 21 days
* Cardiac evaluation: ECG, telemetry, and serum troponin showed no signs of cardiac ischemia or infarction
* Vascular imaging: MRA and CTA showed severe stenosis of the left middle cerebral artery

**Lab Results:**

* Complete blood count (CBC): within normal limits
* Metabolic panel: within normal limits
* PT/PTT: within normal limits
* Fasting glucose: 110 mg/dL
* Hemoglobin A1C: 7.2%
* Lipid profile: HDL 40 mg/dL, LDL 120 mg/dL, triglycerides 150 mg/dL

**Discharge Summary:**

* The patient was admitted to the neurology unit on March 10, 2023, with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke. Upon admission, the patient was found to have severe left-sided weakness and speech difficulty. Imaging studies, including diffusion-weighted MRI and CT scans, confirmed the diagnosis of ischemic stroke.
* The patient received IV antihypertensives to control blood pressure and IV tPA to treat the acute ischemic stroke. Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted but unsuccessful due to large vessel occlusion.
* The patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 days to prevent further ischemic events.
* The patient's cardiac evaluation was normal, and no signs of cardiac ischemia or infarction were detected.
* The patient's vascular imaging showed severe stenosis of the left middle cerebral artery, which may have contributed to the ischemic stroke.
* The patient's lab results were within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated LDL cholesterol level.
* The patient was educated on the importance of risk factor control, including smoking cessation, blood pressure control, and statin therapy to prevent further ischemic events.
* The patient was discharged on the following medications:
	+ Aspirin 325 mg daily
	+ Clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 21 days
	+ Statin therapy (atorvastatin 40 mg daily) to lower LDL cholesterol
	+ Blood pressure medication (labetalol 200 mg daily) to control blood pressure

**Follow-up Instructions:**

* Follow-up appointment with the neurologist in 2 weeks
* Follow-up appointment with the primary care physician in 1 week
* Continue all medications as instructed
* Attend a rehabilitation program to improve functional abilities
* Schedule an appointment with a cardiothoracic specialist to discuss the possibility of anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation
