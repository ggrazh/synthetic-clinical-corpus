**Admission and Initial Evaluation**

The patient was admitted to the traumatology unit on March 10, 2023, after presenting to the emergency department with a left arm injury following a fall from a bicycle. Initial evaluation revealed tenderness and swelling in the left elbow region, with limited range of motion. Radiographs were obtained, which showed a displaced posteriorly angulated distal humeral fracture. The patient was taken to the operating room for emergency orthopedic consultation.

**Surgical Intervention**

On March 11, 2023, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of the distal humeral fracture by an orthopedic surgeon.

The surgical team successfully reduced the fracture, and internal fixation was achieved using a combination of plates and screws.

**Postoperative Care**

The patient was transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for close monitoring and management of pain, nausea, and respiratory status. Postoperative radiographs confirmed the successful reduction and fixation of the fracture. The patient was started on a regimen of pain management medications, including acetaminophen 650mg every 6 hours as needed, and oxycodone 5mg every 8 hours as needed. The patient was also prescribed a course of antibiotics, including cefazolin 1g every 8 hours, to prevent surgical site infection.
