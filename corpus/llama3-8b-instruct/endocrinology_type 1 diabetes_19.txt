**Treatment and Management**

The patient was started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen, consisting of 0.3 units/kg/day of insulin glargine (Lantus) at bedtime and 0.1 units/kg/dose of insulin aspart (NovoLog) before meals. The patient's initial insulin doses were adjusted based on his FPG levels, which were monitored closely during his hospital stay. The patient was also prescribed metformin 500 mg twice daily for glycemic control.

In addition to insulin therapy, the patient was educated on dietary recommendations, which included a high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet with emphasis on whole foods. The patient was also advised to engage in regular physical activity, aiming for at least 150 minutes per week.
