He had a left-sided facial droop, and his left arm was flaccid and non-functional. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was 14.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain was performed, which showed no evidence of hemorrhage. A diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed acute ischemia in the left middle cerebral artery territory. A magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA) of the brain vessels showed 80% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery.

**Laboratory Results:**

The patient's laboratory results showed the following:

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): within normal limits
* Metabolic Panel: within normal limits
* Prothrombin Time (PT) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT): within normal limits
* Fasting Glucose: 120 mg/dL

* Lipid Profile: total cholesterol 220 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 40 mg/dL
* Troponin: 0.1 ng/mL (normal range: 0-0.2 ng/mL)

**Treatment:**

The patient was treated with IV antihypertensives, including labetalol 20 mg every 4 hours and metoprolol 25 mg every 6 hours. He was also administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) 0.9 mg/kg IV (maximum 90 mg) over 60 minutes, with 10% given as a rapid IV injection. The patient's blood pressure was closely monitored, and his systolic blood pressure was maintained below 185 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 105 mm Hg.

**Discussion:**

John Doe, a 48-year-old man, was admitted to the neurology unit with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke. The patient's symptoms were consistent with a left middle cerebral artery territory infarct, which was confirmed by neuroimaging studies. He was treated with IV antihypertensives, tPA, and antiplatelet therapy. The patient's blood pressure was closely monitored, and his systolic blood pressure was maintained below 185 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 105 mm Hg before administration of tPA. The patient was also started on aspirin and clopidogrel for secondary prevention. He was discharged with instructions to continue his medication regimen and to attend follow-up appointments with the healthcare provider.
