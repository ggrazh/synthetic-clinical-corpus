**Chief Complaint and Hospital Course**

Jane Doe, a 45-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. The patient reported a gradual onset of symptoms over the past six months, with worsening fatigue and weight gain over the past three months. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a normal blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature. The patient's thyroid gland was not palpable, and the rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

**Laboratory Results and Diagnosis**

Initial laboratory results showed an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 35.6 mU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.2 mU/L) and a low free T4 level of 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL). The patient's serum T3 level was 1.2 ng/mL (normal range: 1.5-3.5 ng/mL). The patient's complete blood count (CBC) showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dL. The patient's serum cholesterol level was 240 mg/dL.

Based on the laboratory results, the patient was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism. The patient's TSH level was elevated, indicating primary hypothyroidism, and the free T4 level was low, confirming the diagnosis.

**Treatment and Management**

The patient was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day, with a gradual increase in dose every six weeks as needed to achieve a euthyroid state. The patient was also prescribed ferrous sulfate 325 mg orally twice a day for the anemia. The patient was advised to take the medications as directed and to return for follow-up appointments.

**Complications and Interventions**

During the hospital stay, the patient experienced mild hypoxemia, which was managed with oxygen therapy. The patient's serum TSH level was monitored regularly, and the dosage of levothyroxine was adjusted accordingly.

**Discharge Instructions**

The patient was discharged on March 20, 2023, with instructions to continue taking levothyroxine 150 mcg orally once a day and ferrous sulfate 325 mg orally twice a day.
