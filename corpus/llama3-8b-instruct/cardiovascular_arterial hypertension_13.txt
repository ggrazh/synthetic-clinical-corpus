**Chief Complaint**

Mr. Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on March 10, 2023, with a chief complaint of hypertension, which had been diagnosed by his primary care physician several months prior. He reported experiencing headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion.

**History of Present Illness**

Upon admission, Mr. Doe's blood pressure was found to be 160/100 mmHg, which was significantly elevated from his previous readings of 140/90 mmHg. A thorough physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities, except for a slightly enlarged heart on chest X-ray. Initial laboratory tests, including urinalysis, lipid panel, and metabolic panel, were within normal limits.

**Diagnostic Evaluation**

A 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor was placed on March 11, 2023, to assess blood pressure variability. The readings confirmed the diagnosis of hypertension, with an average blood pressure of 158/102 mmHg. Echocardiography and electrocardiogram (ECG) were normal. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were within normal limits, ruling out hypothyroidism as a contributing factor to hypertension.

**Treatment and Management**

Based on the diagnosis of hypertension, treatment was initiated with a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapy. Mr. Doe was instructed to engage in regular physical activity, reduce sodium intake to <1500 mg/day, and adopt a healthy diet. He was also advised to quit smoking and lose weight to reduce his body mass index (BMI).

Pharmacological therapy was started with lisinopril 20 mg orally twice daily, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) 5 mg orally daily, and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally daily. The patient was instructed to take his medications at 8:00 am and 8:00 pm daily.

**Course of Hospitalization**

Mr. Doe's blood pressure was closely monitored during his hospital stay, and adjustments were made to his medication regimen as needed. His blood pressure decreased to 140/90 mmHg by March 12, 2023, and remained stable throughout his hospital stay.

**Discharge Instructions**

Upon discharge, Mr. Doe was instructed to:

1. Continue taking his medications as prescribed.
2. Monitor his blood pressure at home twice daily and record the readings.
3. Adjust his medication regimen as needed based on blood pressure readings.
4. Engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy diet.
5. Reduce sodium intake to <1500 mg/day.
6. Quit smoking and avoid secondhand smoke.
7. Lose weight to reduce his BMI.

**Follow-up Plan**

Mr. Doe was scheduled for a follow-up appointment with his primary care physician on March 25, 2023, to re-evaluate his blood pressure and medication regimen. He was also instructed to return to the hospital if he experienced any worsening of symptoms or side effects from his medications.

**Summary**

Mr. Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit with a diagnosis of hypertension. He was treated with a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological therapy, resulting in a significant decrease in his blood pressure. He was discharged with a comprehensive plan for medication management and lifestyle modifications to ensure effective long-term control of his hypertension.
