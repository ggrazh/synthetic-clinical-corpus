**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**

* Name: John Doe
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1990
* Admit Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 15, 2023
* Gender: Male
* Age: 33 years

**Medical History:**

John Doe was admitted to the infectious diseases unit on March 10, 2023, with a three-day history of symptoms consistent with influenza, including fever, cough, sore throat, and myalgia. He had no significant past medical history, was not taking any medications, and had no known allergies.

**Clinical Course:**

Upon admission, John's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 38.5°C, pulse rate of 100 beats per minute, and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. He was started on symptomatic treatment, including antipyretics and hydration, and was monitored closely for signs of worsening respiratory symptoms.

On March 12, 2023, John's symptoms had worsened, with a temperature of 40.5°C, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. A rapid antigen test and RT-PCR test were performed, and both were positive for influenza A, subtype H3N2. A chest x-ray was also obtained, which showed interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia.

**Treatment:**

Based on the diagnosis of influenza A, subtype H3N2, and the patient's high-risk status, antiviral therapy was initiated. John was started on oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, which was continued for a total of five days. He also received azithromycin 500 mg orally once a day for one day, pending the results of a sputum culture, which ultimately grew no organisms.

**Laboratory Results:**

* Complete Blood Count (CBC): Normal range
* Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Normal range
* Influenza A, subtype H3N2, RT-PCR: Positive
* Chest x-ray: Interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia

**Medications:**

* Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for five days
* Azithromycin 500 mg orally once a day for one day
* Acetaminophen 325 mg orally every six hours as needed for pain and fever management
* Hydrocodone 5 mg orally every six hours as needed for cough management
* Albuterol 2 puffs orally every six hours as needed for bronchospasm management

**Discharge Instructions:**

John was discharged from the hospital on March 15, 2023, with a prescription for oseltamivir and a follow-up appointment scheduled for March 18, 2023. He was advised to continue taking the oseltamivir for the full five-day course, to rest and hydrate, and to return to the hospital if he experiences any worsening symptoms or difficulty breathing.

**Follow-up Care:**

John will be followed up in the clinic to monitor for any residual symptoms and to assess the effectiveness of the antiviral therapy. He will also be advised to receive annual influenza vaccination to prevent future episodes of influenza.

**Conclusion:**

John Doe was diagnosed with influenza A, subtype H3N2, and was treated with antiviral therapy and symptomatic support. He responded well to treatment and was discharged from the hospital without any significant complications. Close follow-up care will be necessary to ensure that he remains asymptomatic and to prevent any potential complications.
