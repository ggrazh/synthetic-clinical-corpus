* Name: Emily Johnson
* Date of Birth: February 12, 1995
* Admission Date: March 10, 2023
* Discharge Date: March 20, 2023

**Chief Complaint**

Emily Johnson, a 28-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit with symptoms of increased thirst and urination, blurred vision, and fatigue. She reported a 2-week history of these symptoms, which had been worsening over the past week.

**Medical History**

Emily had no significant medical history prior to her admission. She was a non-smoker and had no history of substance abuse. She reported a family history of type 2 diabetes in her maternal grandmother.

**Physical Examination**

Upon admission, Emily's vital signs were stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, pulse of 70 beats per minute, and respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute. Her physical examination was unremarkable, except for mild pedal edema.

**Laboratory Results**

Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels of 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 11.2%. Subsequent oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) confirmed the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Other laboratory tests, including complete blood count, liver function tests, and renal function tests, were within normal limits.

**Diagnosis**

Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory results, Emily was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

**Treatment**

Emily was started on basal-bolus insulin therapy, with a total daily dose of 50 units of insulin glargine (Lantus) at bedtime and 20 units of insulin aspart (NovoLog) before meals. She was also prescribed metformin 500 mg twice daily for oral glucose control. Her blood glucose levels were monitored regularly, and she was educated on proper insulin injection technique, blood glucose monitoring, and insulin dose adjustment.

**Medications**

* Insulin glargine (Lantus) 50 units at bedtime
* Insulin aspart (NovoLog) 20 units before meals
* Metformin 500 mg twice daily

**Discharge Instructions**

Emily was discharged with the following instructions:

* Continue basal-bolus insulin therapy as prescribed
* Monitor blood glucose levels regularly and adjust insulin doses as needed
* Follow a balanced diet with emphasis on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates
* Engage in physical activity of at least 150 minutes per week
* Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
* Attend regular follow-up appointments with her primary care physician and endocrinologist

**Follow-up Care**

Emily will follow up with her primary care physician in 2 weeks and with her endocrinologist in 1 month for further monitoring and adjustment of her insulin therapy. She will also be referred to a dietician for personalized dietary counseling.

**Education**

Emily received education on the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications. She was also educated on the importance of regular foot examinations, funduscopic examinations, and annual spot or 24-hour urine testing for albuminuria.

**Preventive Care**

Emily will receive vaccinations for Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2. She will also be referred to a podiatrist for regular professional care.

**Alternative Insulin Delivery Methods**

Emily was informed about alternative insulin delivery methods, including pancreas transplantation and transplantation of pancreatic islet cells, which may be considered in the future if her disease progression warrants it.

By following her treatment plan and attending regular follow-up appointments, Emily is expected to achieve good glycemic control and manage her type 1 diabetes effectively.
