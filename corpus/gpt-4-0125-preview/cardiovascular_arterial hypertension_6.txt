Patient Discharge Summary

**Patient Details:**
- Name: John Doe
- Age: 52 years
- Gender: Male
- Admission Date: October 15, 2023
- Discharge Date: October 22, 2023
- Hospital: Heart Health Cardiovascular Unit

**Admission Summary:**
John Doe was admitted to the Heart Health Cardiovascular Unit on October 15, 2023, with complaints of recurring headaches, episodes of dizziness, and blurred vision over the past two months. Given his family history of cardiovascular diseases and his symptoms, an initial assessment aiming to diagnose or rule out arterial hypertension was performed.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
Upon admission, John's blood pressure was measured using sphygmomanometry in both arms, revealing a higher reading in the right arm (160/100 mm Hg). Subsequent measurements confirmed the initial reading, averaging 158/98 mm Hg over three different occasions under specific conditions as per guidelines. His physical examination noted a body mass index (BMI) of 29, waist circumference of 102 cm, and no immediate signs of target organ damage. Diagnostic testing included urinalysis, lipid panel, comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and an ECG, all within normal limits except for elevated cholesterol levels. Fasting plasma glucose was 98 mg/dL, indicating no diabetic condition. However, given his elevated blood pressure readings across different measurements, John Doe was diagnosed with arterial hypertension.

**Treatment and Hospital Stay:**
John's treatment began with lifestyle modification advice, including a diet with reduced sodium intake (<1500 mg/day), increased physical activity, and an emphasis on weight loss. Pharmacological treatment was initiated with an ACE inhibitor, Lisinopril 10 mg once daily, considering the absence of contraindications. The importance of adherence to both lifestyle changes and medication was emphasized for effective management of hypertension.

Throughout his stay, John's blood pressure showed gradual improvement, stabilizing around 135/85 mm Hg. Daily education sessions on hypertension management, dietary consultations, and physical therapy were part of his comprehensive care. His medication dosage was adjusted on October 18, 2023, to Lisinopril 20 mg once daily after a reassessment of his blood pressure and tolerance to the medication.

**Discharge Instructions:**
John Doe is discharged on October 22, 2023, with his blood pressure under better control but requiring ongoing management. He is to continue taking Lisinopril 20 mg once daily, monitor his blood pressure at home twice daily, and maintain the lifestyle modifications initiated during his hospital stay. A follow-up appointment is scheduled for November 19, 2023, with his primary care physician to reassess his blood pressure and evaluate the need for further adjustments in his treatment plan.
