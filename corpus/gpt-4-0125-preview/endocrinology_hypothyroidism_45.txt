**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe  
- **Age:** 45 years  
- **Sex:** Female  
- **Date of Admission:** November 1, 2023  
- **Date of Discharge:** November 15, 2023  
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton, Endocrinologist  
- **Diagnosis:** Primary Hypothyroidism  

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**  
Jane Doe was admitted to the hospital on November 1, 2023, with complaints of extreme fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance over the past few months. Initial evaluation by the endocrinology team led by Dr. Emily Stanton included a comprehensive history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations focused on thyroid function. 

Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels measured on November 2, 2023, were significantly elevated at 15.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), and free thyroxine (T4) levels were found to be low at 0.5 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), consistent with a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Additional tests revealed normocytic-normochromic anemia and elevated serum cholesterol levels at 245 mg/dL. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was confirmed.

**Treatment Initiated:**  
Given Jane's age and the absence of cardiac disease, treatment with Levothyroxine was initiated on November 3, 2023, at a starting dose of 100 mcg orally once daily. The rationale for this dose was her relatively young age and the need to normalize thyroid function while monitoring for signs of overtreatment, especially given the potential for cardiac complications. 

During her hospital stay, Jane's symptoms and biochemical markers of thyroid function were closely monitored. By November 10, 2023, her TSH levels had decreased to 7.2 mIU/L, indicating a positive response to Levothyroxine therapy, but still higher than the target range, suggesting the need for dose adjustment. Consequently, her Levothyroxine dose was adjusted to 125 mcg orally once daily.

**Discharge and Follow-Up:**  
Jane was discharged on November 15, 2023, with instructions to continue Levothyroxine at the adjusted dose of 125 mcg daily. She was educated on the symptoms of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, indicating underdose and overdose of Levothyroxine, respectively. She was advised to monitor her weight, energy levels, and heart rate at home.

A follow-up appointment has been scheduled with Dr. Emily Stanton in four weeks to reassess thyroid function tests and adjust the Levothyroxine dose if necessary. Jane was also advised to undergo a fasting lipid profile test during her follow-up visit given her elevated cholesterol levels.

**Special Instructions:**  
- Jane has been advised to take Levothyroxine on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before breakfast, to enhance absorption.
- She has been informed of the importance of consistent daily dosing and not to switch brands of Levothyroxine without consulting her endocrinologist due to potential variations in bioavailability.
- Jane was educated on the importance of notifying her healthcare provider if she experiences symptoms such as palpitations, restlessness, or significant weight loss which could indicate overtreatment.
- She has been cautioned to avoid rapid rewarming and to seek immediate medical attention if she experiences extreme weakness or lethargy, as these could be signs of myxedema coma, a rare but severe complication of hypothyroidism.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Levothyroxine 125 mcg orally, once daily, in the morning on an empty stomach.

**Follow-Up Appointment:**  
- With Dr. Emily Stanton, Endocrinology, on December 13, 2023, for reassessment of thyroid function and medication adjustment as needed.

This discharge summary has been prepared to provide a comprehensive overview of Jane Doe's medical journey during her hospital stay for the management of primary hypothyroidism. Her treatment and follow-up plan have been designed to optimize her thyroid hormone levels and improve her quality of life.
