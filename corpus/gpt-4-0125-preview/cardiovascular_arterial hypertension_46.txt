**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of severe headaches and episodes of dizziness for the past 2 weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**  
John Doe, a 58-year-old male with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on October 1, 2023, after presenting with severe headaches and dizziness. The patient reported experiencing these symptoms intermittently over the last two weeks, which had progressively worsened.

**Medical History:**  
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
- Hyperlipidemia  
- No known drug allergies  
- Current medications upon admission: Metformin 500mg BID, Atorvastatin 20mg QD

**Physical Examination:**  
Upon admission, the patient was alert and oriented. Vital signs were as follows: BP 180/110 mm Hg in the right arm and 178/108 mm Hg in the left arm, HR 88 beats per minute, RR 18 breaths per minute, and body temperature 98.6Â°F. Physical examination revealed no additional significant findings.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**  
- **Blood Pressure Measurements:** Confirmed hypertension with multiple readings averaging 180/110 mm Hg.
- **Laboratory Tests:** Urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, and fasting plasma glucose levels were within normal limits except for elevated LDL cholesterol and blood glucose levels. ECG showed no signs of hypertensive heart disease. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within normal range.
- **Diagnostic Imaging:** A chest X-ray was performed and showed no signs of cardiac enlargement or pulmonary edema.

**Hospital Course:**  
John Doe was diagnosed with arterial hypertension. His treatment was initiated with lifestyle modifications, including dietary advice for reduced sodium intake and encouragement of regular physical activity. Pharmacological treatment was started with Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension, and his existing medications for diabetes and hyperlipidemia were continued.

Given the patient's history of diabetes and hyperlipidemia, a comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment was conducted, and it was decided to intensify his lipid-lowering therapy. The dose of Atorvastatin was increased to 40mg daily.

During his hospital stay, the patient's blood pressure readings gradually decreased to a goal of <130/80 mm Hg. The patient tolerated the medication without any signs of adverse effects, and his blood pressure was well controlled on this regimen by the time of discharge.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Lisinopril 10mg QD  
- Metformin 500mg BID  
- Atorvastatin 40mg QD  

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**  
John Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Sarah Lin in the cardiology outpatient clinic on October 28, 2023. The patient has been educated on the importance of adhering to the prescribed medication regimen and lifestyle modifications. He has been provided with a blood pressure monitor for home monitoring and instructed to record his blood pressure twice daily.

The patient has been advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences symptoms such as chest pain, severe headaches, difficulty breathing, or vision changes.

**Conclusion:**  
John Doe was successfully treated for arterial hypertension during his hospital stay from October 1, 2023, to October 14, 2023. He has been discharged with a comprehensive management plan, including medication, lifestyle modifications, and scheduled follow-up care to ensure ongoing monitoring and management of his hypertension.
