**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: John Doe  
ID: 001234567  
Date of Birth: MM/DD/YYYY  
Admission Date: 09/01/2023  
Discharge Date: 09/10/2023  
Attending Physician: Dr. Emily Stanton  
Primary Diagnosis: Arterial Hypertension  

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on September 1, 2023, with complaints of severe headaches and episodes of dizziness. Initial blood pressure (BP) readings were 162/100 mm Hg in the right arm and 160/98 mm Hg in the left arm. Based on the higher reading, subsequent measurements were taken from the right arm. The patient's medical history revealed no prior diagnosis of hypertension, but a family history of cardiovascular diseases was noted.

During his stay, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted, including a detailed patient history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. The patient's height, weight, and waist circumference were recorded, and a physical examination indicated no immediate signs of target organ damage. Diagnostic tests included a urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and ECG, all of which returned within normal ranges except for elevated cholesterol levels. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were also within normal limits. Considering the patient's history and initial presentation, a diagnosis of arterial hypertension was confirmed.

**Treatment Initiated:**  
Lifestyle modifications were immediately recommended, including dietary adjustments to reduce sodium intake to less than 1500 mg/day, increased physical activity, and an emphasis on weight loss to achieve a healthier BMI. The patient was counseled on the importance of these changes in managing hypertension.

Pharmacological treatment was initiated with an ACE inhibitor, Lisinopril 10 mg once daily, considering the patient's overall health profile and absence of contraindications. The choice of medication was based on current guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension, aiming for a target BP of < 130/80 mm Hg.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's BP was monitored daily, showing a gradual decrease to an average of 135/85 mm Hg. The patient tolerated the medication well, with no significant adverse effects reported.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
Mr. Doe was discharged on September 10, 2023, with the following instructions:
- Continue taking Lisinopril 10 mg once daily. The patient was informed not to take any ACE inhibitor or ARB in combination.
- Adhere strictly to the recommended lifestyle modifications, including diet, exercise, and weight management.
- Monitor blood pressure at home twice daily and maintain a log to be reviewed during follow-up visits.
- Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton in 2 weeks for BP reassessment and medication adjustment if necessary. Further evaluation of medication effectiveness and potential side effects will be conducted during this visit.
- The patient was educated on recognizing symptoms of potential complications and the importance of adhering to therapy and lifestyle changes for long-term management of hypertension.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
Mr. Doe was advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences symptoms such as chest pain, severe headaches, visual disturbances, or significant changes in BP readings. A referral to a hypertension specialist may be considered if his BP remains elevated despite adherence to prescribed treatment and lifestyle modifications.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
Mr. John Doe's hospital course was uncomplicated, and he responded well to the initial treatment for arterial hypertension. With continued adherence to prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications, the prognosis is favorable for achieving and maintaining target BP levels, thus reducing the risk of hypertension-related complications.

This discharge summary serves as a comprehensive record of Mr. Doe's hospital stay, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care instructions for arterial hypertension. It will be a crucial document for coordinating care with his primary care physician and specialists as needed.
