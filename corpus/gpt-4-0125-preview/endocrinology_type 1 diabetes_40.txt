During his stay, John was closely monitored for signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. His insulin doses were adjusted accordingly. He received comprehensive diabetes education, covering diet, exercise, medication management, and monitoring blood glucose levels. A dietitian provided individualized dietary recommendations focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. 

John participated in physical activity counseling, emphasizing the importance of at least 150 minutes of exercise per week and adjusting insulin doses or carbohydrate intake to manage exercise-induced hypoglycemia.
