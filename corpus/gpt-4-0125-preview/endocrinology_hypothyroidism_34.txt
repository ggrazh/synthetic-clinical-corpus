**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: Jane Doe  
Age: 45 years  
Sex: Female  
Hospital ID: 123456789  
Admission Date: October 1, 2023  
Discharge Date: October 14, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Emily Stone, Endocrinology  
Primary Diagnosis: Primary Hypothyroidism

**History of Present Illness:**  
Ms. Jane Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on October 1, 2023, with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation over the past 6 months. Her symptoms had progressively worsened, prompting a visit to her primary care physician, who referred her to our hospital for further evaluation.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**  
Upon admission, blood tests were performed revealing elevated serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels at 10 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and low serum free T4 levels at 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Anemia screening showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 240 mg/dL. These findings supported the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism.

**Treatment:**  
Ms. Doe was started on Levothyroxine with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, considering her age and absence of heart disease. Over the course of her hospital stay, her symptoms began to improve, and repeat blood tests on October 7, 2023, showed a decrease in TSH levels to 6 mIU/L and an increase in free T4 to 0.9 ng/dL, indicating a positive response to the therapy.

Given her elevated cholesterol levels, dietary and lifestyle modifications were also recommended to manage her hyperlipidemia alongside hypothyroid treatment.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day. The dose will be re-evaluated in 6 weeks based on TSH and free T4 levels.
- A follow-up appointment is scheduled for November 21, 2023, for TSH and free T4 level re-evaluation and dose adjustment if necessary.

**Instructions for Patient:**  
- Take levothyroxine on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before breakfast.
- Adhere to the prescribed dosage and timing of levothyroxine without interruption.
- Report any symptoms of hyperthyroidism (e.g., palpitations, weight loss, tremors) or worsening hypothyroidism.
- Continue with recommended dietary and lifestyle changes to manage cholesterol levels.

**Follow-up Care:**  
Ms. Doe is advised to follow up with her primary care physician and the endocrinology specialist as scheduled. The importance of adherence to the prescribed medication and follow-up blood tests for TSH and free T4 levels cannot be overemphasized to ensure optimal management of her hypothyroidism.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate levothyroxine therapy and regular monitoring, Ms. Doeâ€™s prognosis is excellent. It is anticipated that her symptoms will continue to improve and her thyroid function tests will normalize with ongoing treatment.
