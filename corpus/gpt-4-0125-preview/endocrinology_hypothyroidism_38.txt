Gender: [Patient's Gender]  
Admission Date: September 15, 2023  
Discharge Date: September 25, 2023  
Attending Physician: Dr. [Physician's Name], MD, Endocrinology  
Hospital: [Hospital's Name]

**Admission Information:**  
The patient was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 15, 2023, with complaints of extreme fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. These symptoms had been progressively worsening over the past six months. The patient's past medical history includes well-controlled hypertension and no known thyroid issues. The family history is notable for hypothyroidism in a first-degree relative.

**Diagnostic Assessment:**  
Upon examination, the patient exhibited dry skin, bradycardia, and delayed ankle reflexes. Initial laboratory tests revealed a serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level of 14 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and a serum free T4 level of 0.5 ng/dL (normal range: 0.8-2.0 ng/dL), indicating primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Anemia screening showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 240 mg/dL. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism.

**Treatment and Management:**  
The patient was started on Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day as an initial dose, considering the patient's age and absence of heart disease. The dose aimed to correct the hypothyroid state and alleviate symptoms. Additionally, the patient was advised on a high-fiber diet and increased fluid intake to manage constipation.

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient's symptoms began to improve gradually. Adjustments in blood pressure medications were made due to improvements in metabolism and subsequent changes in blood pressure. The patient was closely monitored for signs of overtreatment with Levothyroxine, such as palpitations or excessive sweating, but none were observed. Repeat laboratory tests on September 23 showed a decrease in TSH levels to 6 mIU/L and an increase in free T4 to 0.8 ng/dL, indicating an improvement in thyroid function. The Levothyroxine dose was maintained, with plans for outpatient follow-up and dose adjustment based on TSH and free T4 levels.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue taking Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day. The next blood test for TSH and free T4 is scheduled for 6 weeks post-discharge to adjust the Levothyroxine dosage as needed.
- Follow a high-fiber diet and maintain adequate hydration to manage constipation.
- Regularly monitor blood pressure and report any significant changes.
- Watch for symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including palpitations, excessive sweating, and weight loss.
- Scheduled follow-up appointment with Dr. [Physician's Name] in 6 weeks, or sooner if symptoms recur or worsen.

**Precautions and Warnings:**  
- Do not stop taking Levothyroxine without consulting the endocrinology team.
- Inform any healthcare provider about the Levothyroxine therapy before undergoing surgery or starting new medications.
- In case of pregnancy, immediately inform the endocrinology team as Levothyroxine dosage may need adjustment.
