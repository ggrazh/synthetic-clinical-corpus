**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
Name: John Doe  
Age: 58  
Gender: Male  
Medical Record Number: 1234567  
Admission Date: September 20, 2023  
Discharge Date: September 30, 2023  
Attending Physician: Dr. Emily Stanton  
Consulting Services: Neurology, Cardiology  
Primary Diagnosis: Ischemic Stroke  

**Hospital Course:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the neurology unit of our hospital on September 20, 2023, with symptoms of acute onset left-sided weakness and slurred speech that began approximately 3 hours before presentation. Upon arrival, his blood glucose was checked at the bedside, registering at 110 mg/dL. An immediate neurological assessment using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scored him at 12, indicating a moderate stroke. A non-contrast head CT scan was promptly performed, revealing no evidence of hemorrhage but suggesting early signs of ischemia in the right middle cerebral artery territory. These findings were further confirmed by a diffusion-weighted MRI, which showed clear evidence of early ischemia.

Given the timing of symptom onset and after ensuring contraindications were absent (systolic BP was controlled at 182 mm Hg and diastolic BP at 102 mm Hg), Mr. Doe was administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg (total dose of 81 mg, with 8.1 mg given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset.

Subsequent evaluations included cardiac assessments through ECG, telemetry, serum troponin (which was within normal limits), and an echocardiogram that showed normal left ventricular function. Vascular imaging was performed using MR angiography (MRA), revealing moderate stenosis in the right internal carotid artery. Blood tests including CBC, metabolic panel, PT/PTT, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile were within normal ranges or adequately managed.

During his hospital stay, Mr. Doe was started on aspirin 325 mg daily within 48 hours of stroke onset and underwent mechanical thrombectomy on September 21, 2023, due to the presence of a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation with significant salvageable brain tissue. The procedure was successful, and significant reperfusion was achieved.

For secondary stroke prevention, dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated with clopidogrel 75 mg daily in addition to aspirin for 21 days, starting on September 22, 2023. Given the presence of moderate carotid stenosis and considering the risk factors including hypertension and hyperlipidemia, aggressive risk factor management was emphasized, including statin therapy with atorvastatin 40 mg daily.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Aspirin 81 mg daily (down titrated from 325 mg after 21 days)  
- Clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 21 days  
- Atorvastatin 40 mg daily at bedtime  
- Lisinopril 20 mg daily for hypertension  
- Metformin 500 mg twice daily for type 2 diabetes management  

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
Mr. Doe has been referred to outpatient stroke rehabilitation, which will commence within one week of discharge. A follow-up appointment with the neurology clinic is scheduled for October 15, 2023, to assess recovery progress and adjust medications as necessary. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, lipid profile, and diabetes management is critical to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke. Additionally, a follow-up with the cardiology team is recommended to monitor his cardiac status and manage cardiovascular risk factors further.

Patient and family education was provided regarding signs of stroke, the importance of adherence to prescribed medications, lifestyle modifications including diet and exercise, and the recognition of depression or other post-stroke complications.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Recognize the FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, Time to call 911) signs of stroke and seek immediate medical attention if symptoms recur.  
- Adhere strictly to the prescribed medication regimen to manage risk factors and prevent recurrence.  
- Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments and rehabilitation sessions.  
- Report any new or worsening symptoms to a healthcare provider immediately.  
- Engage in recommended lifestyle modifications including smoking cessation, maintaining a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and weight management.
