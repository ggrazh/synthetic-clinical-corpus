**Hospital ID:** [ID]  
**Admission Date:** September 5, 2023  
**Discharge Date:** September 15, 2023  
**Consulting Physician:** Dr. [Physician Name], MD, Endocrinology  
**Diagnosis at Discharge:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**

[Patient Name], a [age]-year-old [gender] with a past medical history significant for hypertension and obesity, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 5, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss over the past 2 months. Family history is notable for type 2 diabetes in both parents. The patient does not smoke and consumes alcohol socially.

On admission, vital signs were within normal limits except for a BMI of 32 kg/m^2. Initial laboratory tests showed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 210 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 9.3%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was not performed due to the conclusive nature of the initial diagnostics. A random glucose value taken on September 6 was 220 mg/dL. Additional screenings revealed microalbuminuria and a slightly elevated serum creatinine level, indicating early nephropathy. The lipid profile was within acceptable ranges, likely due to the patientâ€™s pre-existing statin therapy for hyperlipidemia.

The patient underwent comprehensive diabetic education, focusing on the causes of diabetes, recognizing symptoms and signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and understanding potential diabetic complications. Dietary counseling emphasized whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, customized to the patient's lifestyle and comorbid conditions. Physical activity recommendations included at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic and resistance exercises, with precautions for hypoglycemia.

**Treatment Initiated:**

1. **Metformin:** Initiated at 500 mg orally twice daily, with plans to increase the dose gradually to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
2. **SGLT2 Inhibitor (Empagliflozin):** Started at 10 mg orally once daily, considering the patient's chronic kidney disease to slow disease progression and manage weight.
3. **GLP-1 Receptor Agonist (Semaglutide):** Considering the patient's obesity and the need for weight loss, initiated at 0.25 mg subcutaneously once a week, with a plan to escalate the dose after 4 weeks, aiming for a target dose of 2.4 mg.

**Patient Education:**

- Detailed instruction was provided on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake, although insulin was not initiated at this time.
