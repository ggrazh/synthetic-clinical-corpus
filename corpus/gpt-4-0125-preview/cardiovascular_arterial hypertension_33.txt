**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Date of Birth:** 01/01/1970  
- **MRN:** 0123456  
- **Date of Admission:** 10/15/2023  
- **Date of Discharge:** 10/25/2023  
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Jane Smith, MD  
- **Primary Diagnosis:** Arterial Hypertension  

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit of the hospital on October 15, 2023, with a presenting complaint of severe headaches and episodes of dizziness over the past two weeks. His blood pressure (BP) on admission was recorded at 170/100 mm Hg in the right arm and 168/98 mm Hg in the left arm. Given the higher reading in the right arm, subsequent measurements were taken from this arm. His medical history revealed no prior diagnosis of hypertension but indicated a family history of cardiovascular diseases. 

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
Upon admission, a comprehensive history and physical examination were conducted. Mr. Doe's weight was noted as 95 kg, with a height of 1.75 meters, resulting in a BMI categorizing him as overweight. His waist circumference was 102 cm. A series of diagnostic tests were performed, including:
- Urinalysis: Normal
- Lipid Panel: Elevated LDL cholesterol at 160 mg/dL
- Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits
- Fasting Plasma Glucose: 100 mg/dL
- ECG: Normal sinus rhythm with no signs of hypertensive heart disease
- Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Levels: Within normal range
- Plasma Aldosterone Levels and Plasma Renin Activity: Pending

Considering the guidelines for diagnosing arterial hypertension, Mr. Doe's BP was measured using a properly sized BP cuff and averaged over 2 more readings on separate occasions, confirming the diagnosis of arterial hypertension.

**Treatment:**  
Initial treatment focused on lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes with reduced sodium intake (<1500 mg/day), increased physical activity, and initiation of a weight loss program targeting a gradual reduction to a healthier weight.

Medication therapy commenced with an ACE inhibitor, Lisinopril, starting at 10 mg once daily, considering the patient's overall health profile and absence of contraindications. Given the elevated LDL cholesterol levels, Atorvastatin 20 mg once daily at night was also prescribed. 

Mr. Doe's BP showed a responsive decrease to an average of 140/90 mm Hg during his hospital stay, with significant improvement in symptoms. Education on home BP monitoring was provided, emphasizing the importance of adherence to medication and lifestyle changes.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
1. **Medications:** Continue taking Lisinopril 10 mg once daily every morning and Atorvastatin 20 mg once daily at night. 
2. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Adhere strictly to the low-sodium diet, engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, and pursue weight loss goals as discussed.
3. **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Smith in 2 weeks to re-evaluate BP and medication effectiveness. Immediate consultation is advised if experiencing symptoms such as severe headache, visual disturbances, or chest pain.
4. **BP Monitoring:** Monitor BP at home twice daily, in the morning and evening, and maintain a log to be reviewed during follow-up visits.
5. **Education:** Acknowledge the long-term nature of hypertension management, and the crucial role of medication adherence and lifestyle modifications in controlling blood pressure and preventing complications.
