**Hospital Course:**  
[Patient Name] presented to the emergency department on October 10, 2023, with a 48-hour history of high-grade fever, cough, body aches, and fatigue. Given the clinical presentation and the ongoing influenza outbreak in the community, influenza was suspected.

Vital signs upon admission were notable for fever (temperature of 102Â°F), tachycardia, and normal oxygen saturation on room air.

Initial management included supportive care with acetaminophen for fever and body aches, and adequate hydration was ensured. Due to the severity of symptoms and the patient's risk factors for complications, a decision was made to confirm the diagnosis with a laboratory test. A nasopharyngeal swab was collected and sent for RT-PCR testing for influenza, which returned positive for Influenza A virus on October 11, 2023.

Given the confirmation of the influenza diagnosis and within the 48-hour window of symptom onset, antiviral therapy was initiated. Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day was prescribed for a total of 5 days, starting on October 11, 2023. The patient was also monitored for signs of secondary bacterial infection, and oxygen saturation levels were regularly checked using pulse oximetry.
