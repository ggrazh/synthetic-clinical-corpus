**Patient Information:**  
Name: [Patient Name]  
DOB: [DOB]  
MRN: [Medical Record Number]  
Date of Admission: March 15, 2023  
Date of Discharge: March 22, 2023  
Attending Physician: Dr. [Physician Name]  
Diagnosis: Influenza  

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**  
The patient, a 45-year-old individual with no significant past medical history, was admitted to the infectious diseases unit on March 15, 2023, with a 3-day history of high-grade fever, cough, myalgia, and malaise. Given the clinical presentation and the ongoing influenza outbreak in the community, influenza was highly suspected. The patient reported not having received the influenza vaccine for the current season.

Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 39.2°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. Physical examination revealed mild dehydration and diffuse bilateral wheezing on lung auscultation.

Initial management focused on symptomatic relief, including administration of acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours for fever and body aches, and oral hydration. Aspirin was avoided due to the patient's age and the associated risk of Reye's syndrome. Given the severity of symptoms and the potential for complications, a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained, and RT-PCR testing for influenza was performed, which returned positive for Influenza A.

Considering the patient’s risk of complications, antiviral therapy was initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset. The patient was started on Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for a 5-day course. The choice of antiviral was based on the patient’s ability to tolerate oral medication and the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in reducing the duration and severity of influenza symptoms.

During the hospital stay, the patient underwent chest x-ray and pulse oximetry due to concerns of secondary bacterial pneumonia, indicated by persistent fever and cough. The chest x-ray did not show evidence of lobar or segmental pneumonia, but interstitial infiltrates suggestive of primary influenza pneumonia were noted. The patient's oxygen saturation remained above 94% on room air throughout the stay, indicating no severe hypoxemia.

The patient showed clinical improvement over the following days, with resolution of fever on the third day of admission and improvement in respiratory symptoms. Oseltamivir was well-tolerated, and no significant side effects were reported. The patient was advised on the importance of yearly influenza vaccination and provided with information on preventive measures to avoid future infections.
