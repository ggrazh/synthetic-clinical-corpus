**Admission Summary:**
The patient was admitted to the hospital on September 15, 2023, with complaints of high fever, cough, significant fatigue, and body aches. Given the patient's presentation and the fact that influenza was widespread in the community at the time, influenza was suspected. The patient's medical history was reviewed, noting no significant chronic illnesses, and the patient was up to date on vaccinations, except for the annual influenza vaccine.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**
Upon admission, the patient underwent a thorough clinical evaluation. Vital signs were monitored, showing a fever of 39.2Â°C, with other vitals within normal ranges. A rapid antigen test was initially performed, indicating a positive result for influenza. To confirm the diagnosis and to guide antiviral therapy, an RT-PCR test was conducted, which confirmed the patient was infected with Influenza A. Given the patient's severe respiratory symptoms, pulse oximetry was used, revealing mild hypoxemia, and a chest x-ray was performed, which did not show signs of pneumonia.

**Treatment Administered:**
The patient was started on antiviral therapy within 24 hours of symptom onset. Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day was prescribed for a 5-day course. The patient was also advised on symptomatic treatment, including rest, hydration, and the use of acetaminophen for fever and body aches, carefully avoiding aspirin due to the associated risk of Reye's syndrome.

**Hospital Course:**
Throughout the hospital stay, the patient's symptoms were closely monitored. Within 48 hours of starting antiviral therapy, the patient reported a decrease in fever and an improvement in overall symptoms. The patient was regularly assessed for any signs of complications, including secondary bacterial infections, but none were observed. The patient's oxygen saturation levels gradually improved, and by September 20, 2023, all vital signs were stable and within normal ranges.

**Discharge and Recommendations:**
The patient was discharged on September 22, 2023, with significant improvement in symptoms. The full course of Oseltamivir was completed, and the patient was advised to continue resting at home until fully recovered. Recommendations on hydration and the use of acetaminophen for any residual symptoms were provided. The patient was educated on the importance of annual influenza vaccinations and was advised to receive the vaccine for the upcoming flu season. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for two weeks post-discharge to ensure complete recovery.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, to complete a 5-day course (started on admission).
- Acetaminophen 500 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for fever or pain.

**Follow-Up Appointments:**
- Follow-up with Dr. [Consultant's Name] in the Infectious Diseases Unit on October 6, 2023.
