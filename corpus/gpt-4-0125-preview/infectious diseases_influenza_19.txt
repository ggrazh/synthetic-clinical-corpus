**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: [Patient Name]  
ID: [Patient ID]  
DOB: [DOB]  
Admission Date: September 25, 2023  
Discharge Date: October 2, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. [Physician Name]  
Diagnosis: Influenza A

**History and Presentation at Admission:**  
[Patient Name], a [Age]-year-old [male/female], presented to the emergency department on September 25, 2023, with a 48-hour history of high-grade fever, cough, sore throat, and malaise. The patient reported the onset of symptoms on September 23, 2023, noting a rapid progression in symptom severity, which prompted hospital visitation. The patient has a medical history significant for asthma but no known allergies. Upon presentation, the patient exhibited symptoms consistent with influenza, especially given the known presence of influenza in the community at the time.

**Clinical Findings:**  
Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature of 39.2Â°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. Pulse oximetry showed an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed mild dehydration and diffuse wheezing on lung auscultation. Given the patient's history of asthma and the acute respiratory symptoms, initial management included supportive care and further diagnostic evaluation.

**Diagnostic Workup:**  
A nasopharyngeal swab was obtained and sent for RT-PCR testing for influenza viruses, which returned positive for Influenza A. Rapid antigen test was deferred given the sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR in this clinical scenario. Chest X-ray was performed to rule out pneumonia, which showed clear lung fields with no evidence of consolidation, compatible with primary influenza pneumonia without secondary bacterial infection. Routine blood tests including CBC and CMP were within normal limits except for mild leukocytosis.

**Treatment:**  
Given the diagnosis of Influenza A and the patient's high-risk status due to asthma, antiviral therapy was initiated. Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day was started within 24 hours of symptom onset, continued for a total of 5 days. The patient was also provided with symptomatic support including hydration and acetaminophen for fever and myalgias, while aspirin was avoided due to the patient's age and associated Reye's syndrome risk.

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient's hospital stay was marked by gradual improvement in symptoms. Fever resolved by the third day of admission (September 28, 2023), and respiratory symptoms improved significantly over the course of treatment. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the hospital stay, with improvement in oxygen saturation to 98% on room air by the time of discharge. The patient was advised on the importance of rest and hydration in the recovery phase.

**Discharge and Follow-up:**  
[Patient Name] was discharged on October 2, 2023, with instructions to complete the course of Oseltamivir, maintain adequate hydration, and rest. A follow-up appointment was scheduled with Dr. [Physician Name] in two weeks to assess recovery progress. The patient was also advised to seek immediate medical care if experiencing worsening symptoms, particularly given the underlying asthma.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for 2 more days.  
- Acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours as needed for fever or discomfort.

**Precautions:**  
The patient was educated on the importance of hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with others for at least 24 hours after fever resolution without the use of fever-reducing medications, to prevent the spread of influenza.

**Summary and Recommendations:**  
[Patient Name] was admitted with Influenza A and has shown significant improvement with antiviral therapy and supportive care. The patient is being discharged with instructions to complete the antiviral course, rest, and maintain hydration. Follow-up in two weeks is scheduled to ensure full recovery and manage the underlying asthma appropriately.
