**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Name:** John Doe  
**MRN:** 001234567  
**Date of Birth:** 01/01/1975  
**Admission Date:** 09/15/2023  
**Discharge Date:** 09/30/2023  
**Consultant:** Dr. Elizabeth Smith, MD, Traumatology Unit  
**Diagnosis:** Bilateral Ankle Fractures with Maisonneuve Fracture on the Right

**History and Presenting Complaints:**
John Doe, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital on 09/15/2023 following a fall from a ladder at his workplace, landing awkwardly on both ankles. He presented with severe pain, swelling, and an inability to bear weight on either foot. 

**Clinical Findings:**
Upon examination, John exhibited tenderness around both medial and lateral malleoli, with pronounced swelling and ecchymosis. The Ottawa ankle rules were applied, and it was determined that x-rays were necessary due to his inability to bear weight and the presence of bone tenderness.

**Diagnostic Investigations:**
- **09/15/2023:** Ankle x-rays in anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views were performed, revealing a bimalleolar fracture on the left ankle and a Maisonneuve fracture involving the right ankle with an associated proximal fibula fracture.
- **09/15/2023:** An external rotation stress x-ray indicated tibiotalar subluxation on the right, confirming deltoid ligament injury and joint instability.
- Peroneal nerve function was assessed and found to be intact at the time of diagnosis.

**Treatment:**
- **09/16/2023:** John underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) for the unstable bimalleolar and Maisonneuve fractures. The surgery aimed to realign the bone fragments correctly and maintain alignment during healing.
- **Post-surgery:** John was placed in a walking boot on the left foot and a cast on the right foot to immobilize the fractures and facilitate healing.
- **Medications Prescribed:**
  - Ibuprofen 400 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for pain.
  - Paracetamol 1,000 mg orally every 8 hours for additional pain control.
  - Enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, started post-operatively and continued until discharge.

**Follow-up and Rehabilitation:**
- **Physiotherapy:** Initiated on 09/20/2023, focusing on gentle range-of-motion exercises initially, progressing to weight-bearing as tolerated over the next 6 weeks.
- **09/30/2023:** At the time of discharge, John’s pain was well-controlled, and he was able to ambulate short distances using crutches.
- **Outpatient Follow-up:** Scheduled with Dr. Elizabeth Smith on 10/15/2023 for wound check, removal of sutures, and evaluation of healing progress through repeat x-rays.
- **Long-term Management:** Emphasized the importance of adhering to weight-bearing restrictions, use of prescribed medications, and active participation in prescribed physiotherapy sessions to ensure optimal recovery.

**Prognosis:**
The prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the successful surgical intervention and John’s adherence to post-operative instructions. While the alignment of the fractures was achieved, diligent follow-up is essential to monitor healing and prevent potential complications, including arthritis and recurrent fractures.

**Discharge Instructions:**
1. Keep the surgical sites clean and dry; follow instructions for wound care as provided.
2. Adhere to medication regimen as prescribed for pain management and thromboembolism prophylaxis.
3. Avoid placing weight on the right ankle until the follow-up appointment; use crutches or a wheelchair as needed for mobility.
4. Attend all scheduled physiotherapy sessions and follow the prescribed exercise regimen at home.
5. Report immediately to the hospital if experiencing increased pain, swelling, fever, or any signs of infection.
