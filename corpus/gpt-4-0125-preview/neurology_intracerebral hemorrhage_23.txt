**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
Name: John Doe  
Age: 58 years  
Gender: Male  
Admission Date: October 10, 2023  
Discharge Date: October 24, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Emily Stanton  
Primary Diagnosis: Intracerebral Hemorrhage  

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the neurology unit on October 10, 2023, with a sudden onset of severe headache, right-sided weakness, and altered consciousness. The patient has a medical history of hypertension and was on medication, including amlodipine 10 mg daily. His risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage included his age, hypertension, and a previous smoking history.

Upon arrival, his blood glucose was immediately measured at the bedside, showing a normal level, thus ruling out hypoglycemia as a cause for his symptoms. A complete blood count and coagulation studies were performed, revealing no significant abnormalities. An immediate CT scan of the head was conducted, confirming the presence of a left hemisphere intracerebral hemorrhage without any evidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT angiography did not show contrast extravasation into the clot.

Given the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications were contraindicated. The patient's BP was initially managed with nicardipine, starting at 2.5 mg/hour IV and adjusted to maintain systolic BP around 140 mm Hg without exceeding 15 mg/hour. This treatment aimed to avoid high blood pressure peaks and ensure sustained BP control.

Throughout his hospital stay, frequent monitoring was conducted to avoid hypotensive episodes, with the goal of maintaining BP close to 130/80 mm Hg. His blood pressure was successfully managed within this range without any occurrences of acute kidney injury.

Neurosurgical evaluation determined that surgical intervention was not immediately indicated given the location and size of the hemorrhage. The patient did not show signs of hydrocephalus or require the placement of an external ventricular drain.

During his hospitalization, Mr. Doe did not experience any seizures, and therefore, antiseizure medications were not administered. His neurologic status was closely monitored, and a gradual improvement in his right-sided weakness was observed.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Amlodipine 10 mg orally once daily for hypertension.  
- Nicardipine was discontinued upon achieving stable blood pressure levels.  
- Paracetamol 500 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for headache or pain.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
1. **Follow-up Appointment:** Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton in the neurology clinic on November 7, 2023. Further evaluation of his neurologic recovery and blood pressure management will be assessed during this visit.

2. **Blood Pressure Monitoring:** Mr. Doe has been advised to monitor his blood pressure daily at home and maintain a log to be reviewed during his follow-up visit.

3. **Physical Therapy:** A referral to outpatient physical therapy has been made to aid in the recovery of right-sided weakness and improve mobility.

4. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Recommendations were provided for a low-sodium diet, regular physical activity, and cessation of smoking to reduce the risk of future intracerebral hemorrhage and manage hypertension.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
Mr. Doe has been counseled regarding the importance of adhering to his medication regimen, monitoring his blood pressure, and recognizing signs that require immediate medical attention, such as sudden headache, worsening of neurologic symptoms, or changes in consciousness.

**Emergency Contact:**  
In case of emergency or significant deterioration in his condition, Mr. Doe or his family members are advised to contact emergency services or return to the hospital immediately.
