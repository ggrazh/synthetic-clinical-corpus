**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: [John Doe]  
Age: [29]  
Sex: Male  
Date of Admission: [March 15, 2023]  
Date of Discharge: [March 22, 2023]  
Attending Physician: [Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology]  
Hospital: [General Hospital, Endocrinology Unit]

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss, and general fatigue that had been persisting for approximately 4 weeks.

**History of Present Illness:**  
[John Doe] has been generally healthy with no significant past medical history until the onset of the current symptoms. The patient reported a rapid escalation of symptoms over the past week, prompting the visit to the hospital.

**Diagnostic Assessment:**  
Upon admission, laboratory tests were conducted, including Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C), and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT). The results were as follows:  
- FPG: 280 mg/dL  
- HbA1C: 12.3%  
- OGTT: 320 mg/dL at 2 hours

These results confirmed the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus based on significantly elevated glucose levels and HbA1C â‰¥ 6.5%.

**Hospital Course:**  
Following diagnosis, [John Doe] was initiated on insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia and mitigate symptoms. The patient was educated on the nature of type 1 diabetes, its management, and the importance of monitoring blood glucose levels. The insulin regimen prescribed included:
- Basal insulin: Insulin Glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime.
- Bolus insulin: Insulin Lispro 0.1 units/kg before meals, adjusted based on carbohydrate intake and pre-meal glucose reading.

[John Doe] responded well to the insulin regimen with a significant improvement in blood glucose levels and symptomatic relief. The patient was also educated on diet, exercise, and the importance of regular monitoring of blood glucose. A dietitian consulted the patient to provide a personalized dietary plan focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. The importance of physical activity was emphasized, recommending at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.

**Complications Screening:**  
Screening for diabetic complications was initiated considering the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. A comprehensive foot examination did not reveal any signs of peripheral neuropathy. A referral to an ophthalmologist for a funduscopic examination was made to assess for diabetic retinopathy. Urine testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine measurement were within normal limits, indicating no immediate kidney involvement.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Insulin Glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime.
- Insulin Lispro 0.1 units/kg subcutaneously before meals as per carbohydrate counting and pre-meal glucose levels.
- A prescription for a blood glucose monitoring kit with instructions on frequent monitoring.

**Patient Education:**  
[John Doe] received extensive education on managing type 1 diabetes, including:
- How to recognize signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia.
- The importance of adherence to insulin therapy and how to administer insulin.
- Dietary recommendations and physical activity guidelines.
- The necessity of regular follow-up appointments and screening for complications.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
- Endocrinology outpatient clinic appointment scheduled for [April 5, 2023], with Dr. Emily Stanton for ongoing management and adjustment of insulin therapy.
- Ophthalmology appointment scheduled for [April 12, 2023], for diabetic retinopathy screening.
- Podiatry referral for annual foot examinations.

**Vaccinations:**  
The patient was updated on vaccinations, including influenza, pneumococcal, hepatitis B, and SARS-CoV-2, as recommended for patients with diabetes.

**Summary and Recommendations:**  
[John Doe] was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus and has been stabilized on an insulin regimen. The patient demonstrated understanding of diabetes management and expressed commitment to follow the treatment plan. It is crucial for [John Doe] to adhere to the prescribed insulin therapy, diet, and exercise plan, and to regularly monitor blood glucose levels. Ongoing education, regular screenings for complications, and follow-up with healthcare providers are essential for the effective management of type 1 diabetes.
