**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
- Name: [John Doe]  
- Date of Birth: [01/01/1970]  
- MRN: [123456789]  
- Date of Admission: [09/15/2023]  
- Date of Discharge: [09/25/2023]  
- Admitting Physician: [Dr. A. Smith, MD, Endocrinology]  

**Admission Diagnosis:**  
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. John Doe, a 53-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and obesity, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 15, 2023, with symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, and unexplained weight loss over the past two months. Initial laboratory results revealed a fasting plasma glucose level of 220 mg/dL and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 9.2%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon admission, Mr. Doe was started on an intensive diabetes management plan. His treatment was initiated with Metformin 500 mg twice daily, considering its safety profile and cost-effectiveness. Education sessions on diabetes management, including diet, exercise, and medication adherence, were provided by our diabetes education team.

Dietary consultation was provided, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, with recommendations individualized to accommodate Mr. Doe's preferences and comorbid conditions. Physical activity advice was tailored to include at least 150 minutes per week of both aerobic and resistance exercises. 

Given Mr. Doe's HbA1C levels and the need for substantial weight loss, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, Semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly, was added to his regimen on September 17, 2023. This decision was made to leverage the weight-lowering effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists and to improve glycemic control.

Screening for diabetic complications commenced upon diagnosis. A comprehensive foot examination did not reveal any signs of neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease. Funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist showed no signs of diabetic retinopathy. Urine testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine levels were within normal limits, indicating no current kidney involvement. A lipid profile was obtained, showing elevated LDL cholesterol, for which statin therapy was initiated.

During his stay, Mr. Doe's blood glucose levels were closely monitored, and he demonstrated significant improvement in self-managing his diabetes, including proficient use of a glucometer and understanding carbohydrate counting and insulin adjustment principles.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Metformin 500 mg orally twice a day  
- Semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once a week  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg orally once a day at bedtime for LDL cholesterol management  

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
Mr. Doe is advised to follow up with the endocrinology clinic in two weeks to reassess his HbA1C and make any necessary adjustments to his treatment plan. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was recommended to provide more detailed insight into his glucose patterns and variability.

Patient education on hypoglycemia recognition and management was reinforced. He has been scheduled for a follow-up diabetes education session in one month to ensure adherence to lifestyle modifications and to address any challenges he may encounter.

Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 were updated during his stay, aligning with recommendations for patients with diabetes.

**Discharge Condition:**  
Mr. Doe was discharged in stable condition with improved glycemic control. He demonstrated a clear understanding of his diabetes management plan, including diet, exercise, medication adherence, and the importance of regular follow-up appointments.

**Acknowledgment:**  
The medical team appreciates Mr. Doe's cooperation and active participation in his care plan. We commend his willingness to learn and adapt to his new diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We remain committed to supporting Mr. Doe in his journey towards optimal health and diabetes management.
