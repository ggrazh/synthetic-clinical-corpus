**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: John Doe  
Age: 35 years  
Gender: Male  
Date of Admission: November 1, 2023  
Date of Discharge: November 15, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Lisa Smith, MD  
Primary Diagnosis: Distal Humeral Fractures (Right Elbow)  
Secondary Diagnoses: None  

**History of Present Illness:**  
John Doe was admitted to the traumatology unit on November 1, 2023, following a road traffic accident. He presented with severe pain, swelling, and reduced mobility in his right elbow. Initial assessment suggested a possible distal humeral fracture.

**Clinical Findings:**  
Upon examination, a posterior fat pad was observed on a true lateral x-ray of the right elbow, indicating joint effusion and suggesting an occult fracture. The anterior humeral line deviated, suggesting a posteriorly displaced distal humeral fracture. A complete neurovascular examination was performed, which revealed intact sensorimotor function with mild radial nerve paresthesia. Distal pulses were comparable to the opposite limb.

**Treatment Provided:**  
Given the clinical and radiographic findings, the decision was made to proceed with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) to address the displaced distal humeral fractures. The surgery was successfully performed on November 3, 2023, by Dr. Smith and her team. Post-operatively, the patient was started on a regimen of pain management and antibiotic prophylaxis:

- Ibuprofen 400 mg orally every 8 hours for pain management.
- Acetaminophen 1000 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for additional pain control.
- Cephalexin 500 mg orally every 8 hours for 5 days to prevent surgical site infection.

**Hospital Course:**  
John's post-operative recovery was closely monitored. Neurovascular checks were performed every 4 hours initially, gradually spaced out as the patient remained stable. Physical therapy was initiated on November 6, 2023, focusing on gentle passive range of motion exercises to promote elbow mobility while avoiding stress on the surgical site.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
John was discharged on November 15, 2023. At the time of discharge, he demonstrated improved elbow mobility with manageable pain levels. Instructions were provided for wound care, signs of infection, and the importance of adhering to the prescribed medication regimen. A follow-up appointment was scheduled with Dr. Smith for November 22, 2023, to assess the surgical site and progress in physical therapy. The patient was educated on the importance of gradual reintroduction of activities and was advised to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity involving the right arm until further consultation.

**Splinting and Rehabilitation:**  
A posterior splint was applied immediately post-operatively and was replaced with a hinged elbow brace at discharge, to be worn for 6 weeks. The patient was advised to continue with prescribed physical therapy exercises and to attend regular physical therapy sessions 3 times per week.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
John Doe's hospital course following open reduction and internal fixation of distal humeral fractures was uncomplicated. With adherence to the prescribed rehabilitation program and follow-up care, the prognosis for full functional recovery of the right elbow is excellent. The patient and his family have been educated on the signs of potential complications and instructed to contact the hospital or return to the emergency department if any concerns arise.
