**Chief Complaint:**
Patient was admitted to the neurology unit with symptoms of acute right-sided weakness and difficulty in speech, which began approximately 2 hours before arrival at the emergency department on September 10, 2023.

**Medical History:**
- Hypertension, managed with Lisinopril 20 mg daily
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, managed with Metformin 500 mg twice daily
- No known drug allergies

**Physical Examination and Clinical Findings upon Admission:**
- Blood Pressure: 190/100 mmHg
- Heart Rate: 88 bpm
- NIHSS score was 12, indicating moderate severity of stroke
- Neurological examination confirmed right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia
- Bedside glucose testing showed a reading of 190 mg/dL

**Diagnostic Investigations:**
- CT scan of the head upon admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage, confirming the diagnosis of ischemic stroke.
- Diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain performed on September 10, 2023, showed early signs of ischemia in the left middle cerebral artery territory.
- Carotid duplex ultrasonography indicated moderate stenosis in the left internal carotid artery.
- ECG and echocardiography showed normal cardiac function with no evidence of atrial fibrillation or cardiac source of emboli.
- Blood tests: CBC, metabolic panel, PT/PTT, fasting glucose (190 mg/dL), hemoglobin A1C (7.8%), and lipid profile were within abnormal limits, indicating poor glycemic and lipid control.

**Treatment Administered:**
1. **Acute Management:**
   - IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered within 3 hours of symptom onset. The dosing was calculated based on the patient's weight (80 kg), totaling 72 mg, with 7.2 mg given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes.
   - Blood pressure was managed with IV labetalol to maintain systolic BP < 180 mm Hg before tPA administration.
   - Aspirin 325 mg was initiated within 24 hours of stroke onset.

2. **Secondary Prevention and Rehabilitation:**
   - Following acute management, the patient was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily, initiated on September 11, 2023, for 21 days.
   - Lipid management was optimized with Atorvastatin 40 mg daily, starting September 12, 2023.
   - Glycemic control was addressed by adjusting Metformin to 1000 mg twice daily and introducing Glipizide 5 mg daily.
   - Physical and speech therapy consultations were made, and rehabilitation commenced on September 13, 2023.

**Course in Hospital:**
The patient showed significant improvement over the course of the hospital stay. NIHSS score decreased to 4 by September 20, 2023. The patient's speech improved, and he regained partial strength in the right side. Blood pressure and glucose levels were brought under better control.

**Discharge Plan:**
- Continue dual antiplatelet therapy until October 1, 2023, then maintain on aspirin 81 mg daily indefinitely.
- Continue Atorvastatin 40 mg daily for lipid management.
- Adjusted diabetic medications as mentioned above.
- Follow up with outpatient physical and speech therapy.
- Scheduled follow-up appointments with Dr. Emily Stanton for October 5, 2023, and with the Endocrinology and Cardiology departments within the next month.
- Patient and family educated on stroke signs, the importance of medication adherence, and lifestyle modifications for secondary stroke prevention.
