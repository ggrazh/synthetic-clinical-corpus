**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Name:** John Doe  
**MRN:** 0011223344  
**Date of Birth:** 01/01/1970  
**Admission Date:** 09/10/2023  
**Discharge Date:** 09/25/2023  
**Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton  
**Consultants:** Dr. Alan Rickman, Cardiology; Dr. Susan O'Neil, Vascular Surgery  
**Primary Diagnosis:** Ischemic stroke  
**Secondary Diagnoses:** Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia  

**Hospital Course:**

Mr. John Doe, a 53-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, was admitted to the neurology unit on 09/10/2023 after experiencing sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking. Upon arrival, his initial blood pressure was 190/100 mm Hg, heart rate was 88 bpm, and he was afebrile. A bedside glucose test showed a glucose level of 110 mg/dL. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was promptly assessed by the attending neurologist, Dr. Emily Stanton, with a score of 12, indicating a moderate stroke.

Immediate neuroimaging with a non-contrast CT scan of the head was performed, showing no evidence of hemorrhage but suggesting early signs of ischemia in the left middle cerebral artery territory. Subsequent diffusion-weighted MRI confirmed acute ischemia in the same region. ECG and telemetry indicated no acute cardiac events, but serum troponin levels were slightly elevated. An echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function with no thrombus or significant valvular disease. Vascular imaging, including MRA and CTA, was performed to evaluate for arterial stenosis, revealing moderate stenosis in the left internal carotid artery. Blood tests, including CBC, metabolic panel, PT/PTT, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile, were within normal limits except for elevated LDL cholesterol.

Given the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and the patient's clinical presentation within the 4.5-hour window from symptom onset, IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered at a dosage of 0.9 mg/kg (total dose of 81 mg, with 8.1 mg given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes), after ensuring that brain hemorrhage was excluded by CT, systolic BP was lowered to < 185 mm Hg, and diastolic BP < 105 mm Hg.

Following acute treatment, Mr. Doe's blood pressure was managed with IV antihypertensives, starting with labetalol, transitioning to oral antihypertensives for long-term control. Aspirin at a dose of 325 mg was administered within 48 hours of stroke onset, and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel was initiated on 09/12/2023 for a duration of 21 days due to the patient's high risk for TIA and minor stroke, with aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg given daily.

Throughout his hospital stay, Mr. Doe participated in aggressive rehabilitation, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy, showing significant improvement in motor function and speech. Cardiac evaluation and vascular imaging results were discussed with cardiology and vascular surgery consultants, who recommended medical management with close follow-up.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Aspirin 81 mg, oral, daily
- Clopidogrel 75 mg, oral, daily for 21 days, then discontinue
- Atorvastatin 40 mg, oral, nightly
- Lisinopril 20 mg, oral, daily
- Metoprolol succinate 50 mg, oral, daily
- Rehabilitation exercises as advised by physical therapy

**Follow-Up:**  
Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton in the neurology clinic on 10/10/2023. He will also have follow-up appointments with cardiology and vascular surgery within the next month. Further evaluation of his carotid stenosis and consideration for intervention will be discussed at these appointments. 

**Instructions for Patient:**  
- Continue medication as prescribed.  
- Monitor blood pressure daily and record readings.  
- Attend all scheduled rehabilitation sessions and follow the home exercise program.  
- Report any new symptoms or worsening of current symptoms immediately to your healthcare provider.  
- Follow a heart-healthy diet, limit sodium intake, and maintain a healthy weight.  
- Quit smoking and limit alcohol consumption.  

**Prognosis:**  
Mr. Doe has made significant progress during his hospital stay. Continued rehabilitation and adherence to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications are crucial for his recovery and prevention of future strokes.
