**Reason for Admission:**
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit with a presenting complaint of severe headaches and episodes of dizziness over the past two weeks. He reported a family history of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. Due to the severity of symptoms and potential hereditary predisposition, an in-depth evaluation was initiated to assess his cardiovascular health status.

**Medical History:**
- Family history of hypertension and cardiovascular diseases
- No previous diagnosis of hypertension or other chronic conditions
- Non-smoker, moderate alcohol consumption
- Sedentary lifestyle

**Physical Examination (Upon Admission):**
- Blood Pressure (BP): 158/100 mm Hg in the right arm, 155/98 mm Hg in the left arm
- Heart Rate: 78 bpm
- Height: 180 cm
- Weight: 85 kg
- BMI: 26.2 kg/m^2
- Physical findings: No evident signs of target organ damage. Normal auscultation of heart and lungs. Abdominal examination unremarkable.

**Diagnostic Testing:**
1. **Sphygmomanometry:** Confirmed elevated BP with an average of 156/99 mm Hg from 3 measurements.
2. **Home BP Monitoring:** Indicated to assess 'white coat hypertension.' Average readings: 152/96 mm Hg.
3. **Urinalysis:** Normal
4. **Lipid Panel:** LDL cholesterol mildly elevated
5. **Metabolic Panel:** Within normal limits
6. **Fasting Plasma Glucose:** 96 mg/dL
7. **ECG:** Normal sinus rhythm, no signs of hypertrophy or ischemia
8. **Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone Levels:** Within normal range

**Hospital Course:**
Mr. Doe was diagnosed with arterial hypertension based on consistent elevated blood pressure readings, both in the clinical setting and via home monitoring, alongside the absence of secondary causes. The diagnosis was made in accordance with established guidelines, considering his symptoms, physical examination findings, and diagnostic test results.

**Treatment Initiated:**
1. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Counseled on the importance of increased physical activity, weight loss, adopting a healthy diet, reducing sodium intake to < 1500 mg/day, and moderating alcohol consumption. Provided resources for smoking cessation despite being a non-smoker, to reinforce the importance of avoiding tobacco products.

2. **Medication:** Initiated treatment with Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, at a dosage of 10 mg once daily, considering the absence of contraindications such as severe aortic stenosis. The choice of medication was based on the patient's overall profile and the need for an individualized treatment plan. 

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
- Mr. Doe responded well to the initial treatment, with a notable reduction in blood pressure to 138/88 mm Hg by the time of discharge.
- Advised to continue with the prescribed medication and lifestyle modifications.
- Scheduled a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks with Dr. Smith to reassess blood pressure and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
- Educated on the importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle changes. Instructed on home blood pressure monitoring technique, recording results, and recognizing symptoms of potential complications.
- Highlighted the long-term nature of hypertension management and the crucial role of regular medical consultations to prevent target organ damage and other complications.

**Discharge Medications:**
1. Lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily. Advised to monitor for signs of cough or angioedema and report immediately if such symptoms occur.

**Instructions for Patient:**
- Follow the prescribed medication regimen without interruption.
- Continue with the recommended lifestyle modifications.
- Monitor blood pressure at home as instructed, keeping a log of the readings.
- Attend the scheduled follow-up appointment and any additional tests as recommended.
- Contact the cardiology department for any questions or concerns, especially if experiencing symptoms like severe headaches, visual disturbances, chest pain, or any new or worsening symptoms.
