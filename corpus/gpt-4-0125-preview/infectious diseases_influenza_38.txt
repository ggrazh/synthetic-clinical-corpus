**Admission Summary:**
Upon admission, John Doe was febrile with a temperature of 38.6째C (101.5째F), exhibited signs of respiratory distress, and had an oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Given his respiratory symptoms and the presence of influenza in the community, he was admitted to the infectious diseases unit for further evaluation and management.

1. A rapid antigen test for influenza was initially performed, yielding a positive result for influenza A.
2. Confirmatory RT-PCR testing for influenza A was conducted, corroborating the rapid test results.
3. Chest X-ray revealed no signs of pneumonia. 
4. Pulse oximetry readings fluctuated between 92-95% on room air during the initial 48 hours of hospitalization.

**Treatment Administered:**
1. **Oseltamivir** was prescribed within hours of admission, given as 75 mg orally twice a day for a 5-day course, starting on November 5, 2023. This was in line with guidelines recommending antiviral therapy within 1 to 2 days of symptom onset, especially for hospitalized patients.
2. **Symptomatic Care** included:
   - Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 6 hours for fever and body aches.
   - Hydration was encouraged, with the patient consuming approximately 2-3 liters of water daily.
   - Salbutamol inhaler was used as needed for asthma symptoms, with no exacerbations during the hospital stay.

**Hospital Course:**
John Doe responded well to antiviral therapy, with a significant reduction in fever and respiratory symptoms observed by the third day of treatment. Oxygen saturation improved to consistently above 96% on room air from November 7, 2023, onwards. No secondary bacterial infection was identified, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the hospitalization period.

Given the improvement in clinical symptoms and stabilization of vital signs, John Doe was deemed fit for discharge on November 12, 2023. At the time of discharge, his temperature was 36.8째C (98.2째F), and respiratory symptoms had markedly diminished.

**Discharge Instructions:**

2. **Activity:** Gradual return to normal activities as tolerated. Avoid strenuous exercise for at least one week.
3. **Diet:** Maintain adequate hydration and a balanced diet to support recovery.
4. **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with a primary care physician or an infectious disease specialist within one week post-discharge for evaluation and to ensure full recovery.
5. **Prevention:** Practice good hand hygiene and avoid close contact with individuals displaying flu-like symptoms to prevent the spread of influenza.

**Warning Signs to Watch For:**
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Persistent fever or fever that returns after a period of being fever-free
- Signs of dehydration, such as dizziness and decreased urine output
- Severe or persistent vomiting

**Emergency Instructions:**
If any of the above warning signs occur or if the patient experiences a significant deterioration in their condition, seek immediate medical attention or return to the emergency department.
