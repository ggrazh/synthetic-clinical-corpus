**Summary of Hospital Stay:**  
The patient was admitted to the hospital's Traumatology Unit on September 5, 2023, following a fall from a bicycle resulting in significant pain and decreased mobility in the right elbow. Initial assessment in the Emergency Department revealed swelling and tenderness in the distal humerus region. A true lateral x-ray of the elbow was performed, showing a posterior fat pad sign, indicative of joint effusion, and deviation of the anterior humeral line, suggesting a posteriorly displaced distal humeral fracture.

Given these findings, a complete neurovascular examination was promptly conducted, confirming intact median, radial, and ulnar nerves function, and symmetrical distal pulses when compared to the opposite limb. Based on the diagnosis guidelines, the patient was suspected of having a displaced distal humeral fracture and was admitted for further evaluation and management.

**Management and Treatment:**  
Upon admission, the patient was initially managed with immobilization of the right arm using a splint and was given analgesics for pain management: Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for pain and Ibuprofen 400 mg orally every 8 hours as needed for swelling. Due to the displacement of the fracture, surgical intervention was deemed necessary. On September 7, 2023, the patient underwent open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) of the right distal humerus, performed by Dr. [Surgeon's Name], M.D., an orthopedic surgeon.

The surgery was successful without any intraoperative complications. Postoperative x-rays confirmed proper alignment and fixation of the fracture. Postoperatively, the patient was started on Cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 5 days as a prophylactic antibiotic measure and continued on the previously mentioned pain management regimen. The patient's arm was immobilized in a cast post-surgery.

**Follow-up and Rehabilitation:**  
The patient showed significant improvement during the hospital stay, with gradual reduction in pain and swelling. Neurovascular status remained intact throughout the postoperative period. Before discharge, the patient was evaluated by physiotherapy for initial assessment and guidance on arm mobilization exercises to commence upon cast removal.

The patient was discharged on September 15, 2023, with instructions for cast care, signs of infection or complications to watch for, and a prescription for pain management: Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed and Ibuprofen 400 mg orally every 8 hours as needed. A follow-up appointment with Dr. [Orthopedic Surgeon's Name], M.D., was scheduled for two weeks post-discharge for cast removal and evaluation of healing progress. Further appointments with physiotherapy were also arranged to commence rehabilitation and ensure the restoration of function in the affected arm.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
1. Keep the cast dry and intact. Cover with a waterproof cover when showering.  
2. Elevate the arm to reduce swelling.  
3. Observe for any signs of infection (increased redness, warmth, fever, or unusual discharge from the surgical site) and report immediately.  
4. Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments with the orthopedic surgeon and physiotherapy.  
5. Manage pain and swelling with prescribed medications, following the dosage instructions carefully.  
6. Contact the hospital or surgeon if experiencing increased pain, numbness, or decreased mobility in the affected arm.

**Conclusion:**  
The patient's hospital stay and treatment for a displaced distal humeral fracture were managed according to current guidelines, including surgical intervention and postoperative care. The patient is expected to make a full recovery with adherence to the prescribed rehabilitation program. Continuity of care through scheduled follow-up appointments is crucial for monitoring healing progress and addressing any complications promptly.
