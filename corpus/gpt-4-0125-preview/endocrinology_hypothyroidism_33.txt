**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe  
- **Age:** 45 years  
- **Sex:** Female  
- **Admission Date:** September 10, 2023  
- **Discharge Date:** September 24, 2023  
- **Hospital ID:** 00567289  

**Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton, Endocrinology  
**Consultations:** Cardiology, Nutrition and Dietetics  
**Primary Diagnosis:** Primary Hypothyroidism  

**History of Present Illness:**  
Ms. Jane Doe presented to the outpatient department on September 9, 2023, with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance persisting for the past 6 months. Initial blood tests revealed elevated Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and low serum free T4, prompting her admission into the Endocrinology Unit for further evaluation and management.

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon admission, comprehensive evaluations were undertaken. Key findings included:
- Serum TSH: 14 mIU/L (normal range: 0.5-4.5 mIU/L)
- Free T4: 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL)
- Total Cholesterol: 245 mg/dL
- Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL, normocytic-normochromic anemia
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed no significant abnormalities.

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was confirmed. Ms. Doe was initiated on Levothyroxine therapy starting at 100 mcg orally once a day, considering her age and absence of known heart disease. 

During her hospital stay, she was closely monitored for any adverse reactions to the medication, and adjustments were made accordingly. Her TSH levels were re-evaluated on September 20, 2023, showing a decrease to 7 mIU/L, indicating a positive response to the treatment. 

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- **Levothyroxine 100 mcg** orally once a day. The dose will be re-evaluated in 6 weeks with a repeat TSH and free T4 measurement.

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**  
- Ms. Doe has been scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the Endocrinology clinic on November 5, 2023, for reassessment of her thyroid function tests and possible adjustment of her Levothyroxine dosage.
- She has been advised to maintain a balanced diet and was provided dietary counseling to manage her weight gain associated with hypothyroidism. A referral to the Nutrition and Dietetics department was made for ongoing support.
- Regular exercise tailored to her cardiovascular health status has been recommended to aid in weight management and overall well-being.
- Ms. Doe has been educated about the signs of both over and under-replacement of thyroid hormone and instructed to seek medical attention if she experiences symptoms such as palpitations, increased anxiety, unexplained weight loss, or persistent fatigue and weight gain.

**Special Instructions:**  
- It is critical to maintain consistency in taking Levothyroxine on an empty stomach and to avoid taking it within 4 hours of calcium or iron supplements to ensure optimal absorption.
- Ms. Doe has been advised against the use of any over-the-counter supplements containing iodine or thyroid extracts without prior consultation with her endocrinologist.
- In the case of developing symptoms suggestive of cardiac issues, Ms. Doe should seek immediate medical evaluation given her therapy with Levothyroxine.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
Ms. Jane Doe has been managed for primary hypothyroidism with initiation of Levothyroxine therapy, which she has tolerated well. Early indications suggest a positive response to treatment. With appropriate follow-up and adherence to medication, the prognosis is excellent. She has been discharged in stable condition with detailed follow-up instructions.
