**Discharge Medications:**  
- **Insulin Glargine:** 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime
- **Insulin Lispro:** As per sliding scale prior to meals

**Follow-Up Appointments:**  
- Endocrinology follow-up with Dr. Alan Turing in 2 weeks for diabetes management.
- Ophthalmology follow-up in 12 months.
