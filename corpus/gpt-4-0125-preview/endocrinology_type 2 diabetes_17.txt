**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Age:** 52  
- **Sex:** Male  
- **MRN:** 0123456789  
- **Date of Admission:** September 20, 2023  
- **Date of Discharge:** September 30, 2023  
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology  
- **Primary Diagnosis:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  

**Hospital Course:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 20, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unintentional weight loss over the past three months. On admission, his fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was 220 mg/dL, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) was 9.2%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. An Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) was not performed considering the clear diagnosis from FPG and HbA1C levels.

Given Mr. Doeâ€™s diagnosis, screening for diabetic complications commenced immediately. His initial foot and funduscopic examinations were normal. Urine testing revealed microalbuminuria. Serum creatinine and lipid profile were within the normal range except for elevated triglycerides at 250 mg/dL.

**Treatment Initiated:**  
- **Metformin:** Started at 500mg twice daily, with meals, to manage his hyperglycemia. This dosage was chosen based on its effectiveness, safety profile, and cost-effectiveness as the first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes.
  
- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Mr. Doe received education on the importance of diet and exercise in managing diabetes. He was advised to follow a diet focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, individualized to his needs, and to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week.

**Patient Education:**  
Comprehensive diabetes education was provided, covering the causes and management of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and potential diabetic complications. Mr. Doe was trained on monitoring his blood glucose levels and adjusting his insulin doses based on these readings and his carbohydrate intake. Special emphasis was placed on the importance of regular professional podiatric care and vaccinations, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
- Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic with Dr. Emily Stanton on October 15, 2023, to assess his response to the treatment and adjust his medication regimen if necessary.
  
- It is recommended that Mr. Doe continues with the prescribed dose of metformin and adheres to the lifestyle modifications discussed during his hospital stay. His metformin dose may need adjustment based on his follow-up HbA1C and fasting glucose levels.
  
- Continuous monitoring of his blood glucose levels is crucial, aiming for an HbA1C < 7%. Adjustments to his treatment plan, including the potential addition of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors, should be considered based on his progress and any side effects.
  
- Mr. Doe is advised to maintain regular foot care and promptly report any signs of foot injury or infection. Moreover, he should continue with the recommended vaccinations to prevent infections.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- **Metformin:** 500mg orally twice daily with meals.  
- **Patient has been provided a glucometer for regular blood glucose monitoring at home.**
