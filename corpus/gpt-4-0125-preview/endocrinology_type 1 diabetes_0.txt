**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Hospital Name:** Metropolitan Endocrinology Unit  
**Patient Name:** [Patient Name]  
**Patient ID:** [ID Number]  
**Admission Date:** September 12, 2023  
**Discharge Date:** September 22, 2023  
**Consulting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology  
**Diagnosis:** Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**

[Patient Name], a [Age]-year-old [Gender] with no significant past medical history, presented to the Emergency Department on September 12, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unintentional weight loss over the past two months. Given the clinical presentation, blood samples were collected for laboratory analysis. The patient's fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was found to be 280 mg/dL, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) was 12.3%, confirming the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. Ketones were detected in the urine, indicating ketoacidosis, which necessitated immediate management and further evaluation in the Endocrinology Unit.

Upon admission to the Endocrinology Unit, a comprehensive diabetes education program was initiated, covering diet, exercise, medication, and monitoring of blood glucose levels. The patient was started on insulin therapy, consisting of a basal-bolus regimen. Insulin detemir was administered as the basal insulin at a dose of 0.4 units/kg/day, divided into two doses. Insulin lispro was prescribed for bolus doses at a ratio of 1 unit per 10 grams of carbohydrates, with dosing adjusted based on pre-meal blood glucose readings.

The patient responded well to the initiated treatment, showing significant improvement in blood glucose levels, with fasting levels consistently below 130 mg/dL and postprandial levels below 180 mg/dL. Education on the recognition and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia was provided, along with instruction on the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for more effective diabetes management.

A multidisciplinary team, including a dietitian and a diabetes educator, provided individualized dietary recommendations focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. The patient was advised on the importance of physical activity, with a recommendation of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.

Complication screening initiated during the hospital stay included a comprehensive foot examination, which showed no signs of peripheral neuropathy. A referral to an ophthalmologist was made for a detailed funduscopic examination. A spot urine test for albuminuria and a serum creatinine measurement were performed, both of which were within normal limits. The patient's lipid profile was checked, revealing no significant abnormalities.

The patient was vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 as per the guidelines for patients with diabetes.

**Medications at Discharge:**
- Insulin detemir: 0.4 units/kg/day, divided into two doses.
- Insulin lispro: Dosed according to the carbohydrate content of meals and pre-meal blood glucose levels.
- Multivitamin: One tablet daily.

**Follow-Up Care:**
1. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. Emily Stanton in the Endocrinology clinic on October 10, 2023, for diabetes management reassessment and HbA1C monitoring.
2. A referral to an ophthalmologist is in place for an annual funduscopic examination.
3. The patient is advised to monitor blood glucose levels at home using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and to record daily readings for review during the follow-up appointment.
4. Continuous diabetes education and support are recommended, with emphasis on recognizing signs of potential complications.

**Patient Education:**
The patient received comprehensive education on managing Type 1 Diabetes, including insulin administration, dietary management, exercise, and the importance of regular monitoring of blood glucose levels. Instruction was also provided on the management of potential side effects of insulin therapy and the signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.

**Discharge Instructions:**
1. Continue with the prescribed insulin regimen and monitor blood glucose levels as instructed.
2. Follow the dietary and exercise recommendations provided by the dietitian and diabetes educator.
3. Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments.
4. Contact the Endocrinology Unit if any issues arise, particularly if experiencing symptoms of hypo- or hyperglycemia.

This discharge summary is prepared for [Patient Name] to ensure a smooth transition from hospital to home care and to facilitate optimal management of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
