Dietary consultation was provided, emphasizing whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. The patient was educated on the importance of monitoring blood glucose levels, recognizing signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and understanding the symptoms of diabetic complications. Instruction on adjusting insulin doses based on carbohydrate intake, although not immediately applicable, was provided for future reference.
