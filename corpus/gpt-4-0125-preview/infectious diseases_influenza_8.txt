**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Age:** 35 years  
- **Sex:** Male  
- **Admission Date:** November 12, 2023  
- **Discharge Date:** November 19, 2023  
- **Hospital:** Metropolitan Infectious Diseases Unit  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department on November 12, 2023, with complaints of high fever (up to 102°F), severe muscle aches, cough, and marked fatigue, symptoms that had been progressively worsening over the past 48 hours.

**History of Present Illness:**  
John Doe, a 35-year-old male with no significant past medical history, began experiencing symptoms consistent with influenza, including high fever, cough, and myalgia approximately 2 days prior to admission. Given the current influenza outbreak in the community and the patient's deteriorating condition, he sought medical attention.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
Upon admission, a rapid antigen test was performed, indicating a positive result for influenza A. Due to the patient's severe symptoms and the need for hospitalization, an RT-PCR test was conducted, confirming the initial diagnosis and differentiating the influenza strain as H3N2. Pulse oximetry showed mild hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and a chest x-ray revealed interstitial infiltrates, suggestive of primary influenza pneumonia. No secondary bacterial infection was identified at the time of admission.

**Treatment:**  
The patient was started on antiviral therapy within the first 24 hours of symptom onset. Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day was prescribed for a 5-day course. Given the patient's hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen was administered via a nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%. Symptomatic treatment included acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours for fever and body aches, and adequate hydration was emphasized. Aspirin was avoided given the patient’s age and the associated risk of Reye's syndrome. The patient showed significant improvement in symptoms following the initiation of antiviral therapy. Oxygen therapy was gradually tapered off as the patient's oxygen saturation levels improved to consistently stay above 95% on room air.

**Hospital Course:**  
John Doe's hospital stay was marked by gradual improvement. By the third day of admission (November 15, 2023), his fever had resolved, and his cough and myalgia were significantly reduced. The 5-day course of Oseltamivir was completed as prescribed, with the last dose administered on November 16, 2023. Repeat chest x-ray on November 17, 2023, showed resolution of the interstitial infiltrates. The patient was monitored for an additional 2 days to ensure the stability of his respiratory status and overall improvement in symptoms.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- **Medications:** No further antiviral medication is required. Continue acetaminophen as needed for any residual body aches or low-grade fever.
- **Activity:** Gradual return to normal activities as tolerated. It is recommended to avoid strenuous activities for the next 1-2 weeks.
- **Diet:** Adequate hydration and a balanced diet to support recovery.
- **Follow-up:** Scheduled for a follow-up visit with the primary care physician in 1 week or sooner if symptoms recur or worsen.
- **Prevention:** Advised on the importance of yearly influenza vaccination to prevent future infections and to avoid close contact with sick individuals, especially during influenza season.

**Summary:**  
John Doe was admitted to the Metropolitan Infectious Diseases Unit with a confirmed diagnosis of influenza A (H3N2). He received timely antiviral treatment with Oseltamivir, supplemental oxygen for mild hypoxemia, and supportive care for symptomatic relief. The patient showed significant improvement and has been discharged with instructions to support his continued recovery at home.
