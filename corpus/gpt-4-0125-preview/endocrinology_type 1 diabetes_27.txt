**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Name:** [Patient's Full Name]  
**Patient ID:** [Unique ID]  
**Date of Birth:** [DOB]  
**Admitting Date:** June 10, 2023  
**Discharge Date:** June 24, 2023  
**Consulting Physician:** Dr. [Physician's Name]  
**Consulting Department:** Endocrinology  
**Primary Diagnosis:** Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus  

**History and Presenting Complaints:**  
[Patient's Full Name], a [Age]-year-old [Gender], was admitted to the Endocrinology unit on June 10, 2023, with symptoms of polydipsia, polyuria, unexplained weight loss, and general fatigue over the past few weeks. The patient has no known history of diabetes in the family and was previously healthy with no significant medical history.

**Clinical Findings:**  
Upon admission, vital signs were within normal limits apart from a slightly elevated blood pressure (BP: 135/85 mmHg). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was recorded at 250 mg/dL, and a random plasma glucose measure indicated a value of 280 mg/dL. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was not performed due to the clear diagnostic plasma glucose levels. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level was 12%, significantly above the diagnostic threshold for diabetes. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes was made.

**Treatment and Management:**  
The patient was immediately started on insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia. A basal-bolus insulin regimen was introduced, consisting of:
- Insulin Glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime for basal coverage.
- Insulin Lispro 0.1 units/kg at mealtime to control postprandial glucose excursions.

Frequent blood glucose monitoring was implemented, with adjustments made to insulin dosages based on results. The patient was educated on the importance of monitoring blood glucose levels, recognizing signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and the administration of insulin. Information on diet, emphasizing whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, and the importance of regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes per week) was provided.

**Complications:**  
No significant complications were encountered during the hospital stay. The patient responded well to insulin therapy, with subsequent blood glucose levels gradually decreasing to target ranges.

**Screening and Preventative Measures:**  
Screening for diabetic complications was initiated, including:
- Comprehensive foot examination revealing no signs of peripheral neuropathy.
- Referral to an ophthalmologist for a funduscopic examination to screen for diabetic retinopathy.
- A spot urine test for albuminuria and serum creatinine measurement indicated no kidney involvement.
- A lipid profile was obtained, showing slightly elevated LDL cholesterol levels. Dietary modifications were recommended.

**Immunizations:**  
The patient was updated on necessary vaccines, including influenza, hepatitis B, and SARS-CoV-2, to prevent common infections.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue with prescribed insulin regimen and monitor blood glucose levels as instructed.
- Follow the dietary and exercise recommendations provided.
- Attend scheduled follow-up appointments with the Endocrinology team and ophthalmologist.
- Monitor for signs of hypoglycemia (such as dizziness, sweating, confusion) and hyperglycemia (increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue) and report any significant changes.
- Referral to a diabetes educator for further education and support in managing type 1 diabetes.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the Endocrinology clinic on July 15, 2023, to assess glycemic control, insulin therapy adjustment if needed, and management of any emerging complications.
