**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**
- **Name:** John Doe
- **Age:** 45
- **Sex:** Male
- **Admission Date:** September 10, 2023
- **Discharge Date:** September 20, 2023
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton
- **Diagnosis:** Distal Humeral Fractures

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the traumatology unit of our hospital on September 10, 2023, following a fall from a ladder at home, resulting in an immediate and severe pain in his right elbow. Upon presentation, Mr. Doe was in significant distress, and his right elbow displayed marked swelling and deformity.

Initial examination revealed limited range of motion in the right elbow, and a neurovascular examination was promptly performed to assess median, radial, and ulnar nerves function, which was found to be intact. Distal pulses were present and symmetrical when compared to the opposite limb. True lateral x-rays of the elbow were obtained, revealing a posterior fat pad sign and deviation of the anterior humeral line from the middle of the capitellum, suggesting a posteriorly displaced distal humeral fracture.

Based on the guidelines for diagnosing and treating distal humeral fractures, Mr. Doe's injury was classified as a displaced distal humeral fracture necessitating surgical intervention. He was scheduled for open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) surgery, which was successfully performed on September 12, 2023, by Dr. Laura Hughes, a senior orthopedic surgeon.

**Treatment Provided:**
Post-surgery, Mr. Doe was started on a regimen for pain management and infection prevention, which included:
- Ibuprofen 400 mg orally every 6 hours for pain and inflammation
- Acetaminophen 1000 mg orally every 8 hours for additional pain control
- Cephalexin 500 mg orally every 8 hours for 7 days to prevent postoperative infection

In addition to pharmacotherapy, Mr. Doe underwent daily physiotherapy sessions starting from September 14, 2023, to gradually restore range of motion and strengthen the muscles around the elbow.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
Mr. Doe showed considerable improvement during his hospital stay, with decreased swelling, improved range of motion, and pain management. He was discharged on September 20, 2023, with the following recommendations:
- Continue oral antibiotics until the course is completed.
- Pain management with Ibuprofen 400 mg and Acetaminophen 1000 mg as prescribed, with instructions to taper off the medication as pain subsides.
- Keep the elbow immobilized in a sling for 2 weeks post-discharge.
- Outpatient physiotherapy sessions thrice a week for the next 6 weeks to continue rehabilitation.
- Scheduled follow-up appointment with Dr. Laura Hughes on October 4, 2023, for postoperative assessment and to ensure proper healing of the fracture.
- Immediate consultation is advised if Mr. Doe experiences increased pain, swelling, fever, or any signs of infection or if he notices any changes in sensation or movement in the affected limb.

**Discharge Instructions:**
Mr. Doe has been provided with detailed written instructions regarding medication dosages, wound care, activity restrictions, and signs of complications to monitor. He has been advised to elevate the limb and apply ice packs to reduce swelling. He has been educated on the importance of adhering to the follow-up care plan to ensure optimal recovery.

**Conclusion:**
Mr. John Doe's hospital stay was marked by a successful surgical intervention and a positive response to postoperative care. He has been equipped with the necessary information and support for a continued recovery at home, with a structured follow-up plan in place to monitor his progress.
