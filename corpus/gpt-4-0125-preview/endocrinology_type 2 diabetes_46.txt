**Hospital Course:**  
[Patient Name] was admitted to the endocrinology unit on July 10, 2023, with complaints of persistent fatigue, excessive thirst, and frequent urination. Initial laboratory tests revealed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 240 mg/dL and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 9.2%, confirming the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

**Medications:**  
1. **Metformin:** Initiated at 500 mg twice daily, with meals, to improve glycemic control. The dosage was gradually increased to 1000 mg twice daily by the end of the hospital stay.
2. **Semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist):** Started at 0.25 mg once weekly, subcutaneously, with the dose adjusted to 0.5 mg after one week based on tolerance and glycemic response.

**Management and Education:**  
[Patient Name] underwent several educational sessions focusing on the management of Type 2 Diabetes, including:
- Understanding the causes and complications of diabetes.
- Recognizing symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
- Dietary counseling emphasizing whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, personalized to accommodate the patient's preferences and comorbid conditions.
- Introduction to physical activity guidelines recommending at least 150 minutes of aerobic and resistance exercise per week, with specific strategies to minimize hypoglycemia risk.
- Self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, with training on adjusting insulin doses (if needed in the future) based on glucose readings and carbohydrate intake.
- Instruction on proper foot care and the importance of regular podiatric consultations.

**Screening for Complications:**  
Comprehensive screening for diabetic complications was initiated, including:
- Foot examination revealing no sensory loss or circulatory impairment.
- Funduscopic examination performed, with no signs of diabetic retinopathy.
- Urine testing for albuminuria and measurement of serum creatinine to assess kidney function, both of which were within normal limits.
- Lipid profile obtained, indicating elevated LDL cholesterol, for which dietary modifications and statin therapy were recommended.

**Vaccinations:**  
[Patient Name] received vaccinations against influenza, pneumococcal pneumonia, and Hepatitis B during the hospital stay. Verification of previous vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was noted in the patient's chart.

**Discharge Instructions:**

- **Diet and Exercise:** Follow the personalized dietary and physical activity plan provided. Record daily food intake and exercise duration.
- **Blood Glucose Monitoring:** Check fasting blood glucose daily and postprandial glucose levels as directed. Maintain a log of the readings to discuss during follow-up visits.
- **Foot Care:** Inspect feet daily for any cuts, blisters, or sores. Schedule regular appointments with a podiatrist.
- **Follow-Up Appointments:** Scheduled with Dr. [Physician Name] on August 20, 2023, for a comprehensive evaluation and to discuss the progress of diabetes management.

**Emergency Instructions:**  
Instructed to seek immediate medical attention if experiencing symptoms of severe hypoglycemia (confusion, seizures, loss of consciousness) or if blood glucose levels are consistently above 300 mg/dL despite medication.
