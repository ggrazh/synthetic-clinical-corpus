**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: John Doe  
Age: 54  
Gender: Male  
Date of Admission: October 10, 2023  
Date of Discharge: October 17, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Jane Smith, MD, Cardiovascular Unit

**Reason for Admission:**  
John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit with complaints of severe headaches, episodes of dizziness, and a history of uncontrolled blood pressure. Initial blood pressure readings in the emergency department were 180/110 mm Hg in the right arm and 178/108 mm Hg in the left arm.

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon admission, a comprehensive history was taken, revealing Mr. Doe had been experiencing these symptoms intermittently over the past six months. He reported a family history of hypertension but no personal history of diabetes, kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease. Physical examination upon admission included measuring height (5'9"), weight (230 lbs), and waist circumference (44 inches), which indicated obesity as a contributing factor to his hypertension.

Diagnostic tests were conducted, including urinalysis, a complete lipid panel, a comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and an electrocardiogram (ECG). The results suggested no immediate signs of target organ damage but did indicate hyperlipidemia and prediabetes. Based on these findings, and considering Mr. Doe's history of uncontrolled hypertension and lifestyle, he was diagnosed with arterial hypertension.

**Treatment:**  
Treatment was initiated with lifestyle modification advice, including a recommendation for increased physical activity, a diet aimed at weight loss with reduced sodium intake (<1500 mg/day), and smoking cessation, although Mr. Doe is a non-smoker. Pharmacological treatment was initiated with Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, at a dosage of 10 mg once daily, and a thiazide diuretic, Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily, to address the volume component of his hypertension.

During his hospital stay, Mr. Doe's blood pressure was monitored closely, showing a gradual decrease to more acceptable levels. On October 12, his blood pressure stabilized at an average of 135/85 mm Hg. Given the initial high readings and the potential for 'white coat hypertension,' Mr. Doe was also educated on home blood pressure monitoring and was advised to purchase a calibrated sphygmomanometer.

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**  
Mr. Doe has been scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Smith in two weeks to reassess blood pressure and medication effectiveness. It is crucial that he adheres to the prescribed medication regime and lifestyle modifications to manage his hypertension effectively. Adjustment in medication dosage or the addition of another antihypertensive may be considered based on his follow-up blood pressure readings and tolerance to the current regimen.

Mr. Doe has been educated on the signs and symptoms that would necessitate immediate medical attention, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, severe headaches, or significant changes in vision. He understands the importance of medication adherence and lifestyle changes in the management of hypertension and has committed to implementing these changes. 

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Lisinopril 10 mg, oral, once daily in the morning.  
- Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg, oral, once daily in the morning.

**Patient Education:**  
- Importance of adherence to therapy and lifestyle modifications.  
- How to monitor blood pressure at home.  
- Recognizing symptoms of potential complications.  
- Understanding the long-term nature of hypertension management.
