**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented to the emergency department on March 5, 2023, with a 48-hour history of high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and profound fatigue. 

**History of Present Illness:**  
[Patient Name], a [patient age]-year-old [patient gender] with no significant past medical history, began experiencing symptoms consistent with influenza two days prior to admission. Despite initial self-care measures, including over-the-counter fever reducers and increased fluid intake, the patient's condition did not improve, prompting hospital evaluation.

**Physical Examination:**  
Upon admission, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 39.2°C (102.5°F), had a pulse rate of 102 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. Examination revealed nasal congestion, pharyngeal erythema without exudate, and mild diffuse myalgias. Lung auscultation was clear, and no skin rashes were observed.

**Diagnostic Workup:**  
- Rapid antigen test for influenza: Positive for Influenza A.  
- RT-PCR test confirmed Influenza A subtype H3N2.  
- Chest X-ray: No evidence of pneumonia.  
- Pulse oximetry: 96% on room air.  

Given the positive rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests, confirming Influenza A, and the absence of bacterial superinfection signs on chest X-ray, the patient was diagnosed with influenza and admitted for further management due to dehydration and high fever.
