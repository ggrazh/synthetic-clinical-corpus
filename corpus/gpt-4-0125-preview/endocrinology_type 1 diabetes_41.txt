- Insulin Lispro 0.1 unit/kg before meals for bolus coverage.

The dosages were adjusted based on continuous glucose monitoring and pre-meal and bedtime capillary blood glucose levels. The patient received comprehensive diabetes education, including dietary recommendations, physical activity, recognizing signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and insulin administration techniques. Nutritional counseling focused on a balanced diet rich in whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, with a caloric intake tailored to the patient's weight management goals.
