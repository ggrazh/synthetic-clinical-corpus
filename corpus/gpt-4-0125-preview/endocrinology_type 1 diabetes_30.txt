**History and Presenting Complaints:**  
[Patient Name], a [Patient Age]-year-old [Patient Sex], was admitted to the endocrinology unit on June 10, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss, and general fatigue persisting over the past month. The patient reported no significant medical history prior to these symptoms. No family history of diabetes was reported. The patient's body mass index (BMI) was noted to be within the normal range upon admission.

**Diagnostic Assessment:**  
Upon admission, the following diagnostic evaluations were performed:

1. **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG):** Results indicated a glucose level of 250 mg/dL, suggesting diabetes.
2. **Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C):** The HbA1C level was measured at 12%, confirming poor glycemic control over the past three months.
3. **C-Peptide Test:** Low levels of C-peptide were indicative of reduced insulin production, supporting a diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
4. **Autoantibody Tests:** Positive for islet cell antibodies, further confirming Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.
5. **Other Tests:** Renal function tests, lipid profile, and liver function tests were within normal limits. Urine tests showed no signs of albuminuria.

**Hospital Course and Management:**  
Following the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, [Patient Name] was immediately started on insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia and mitigate symptoms. The patient was managed with a basal-bolus insulin regimen:

1. **Basal Insulin:** Insulin Glargine, 10 units at bedtime.
2. **Bolus Insulin:** Insulin Lispro, initiated at 4 units before meals, adjusted according to carbohydrate intake and pre-meal blood glucose levels.

The patient underwent diabetes education sessions, focusing on understanding the disease, insulin administration techniques, diet, exercise, and monitoring blood glucose levels. A registered dietitian provided individualized dietary advice, emphasizing whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. The patient was encouraged to engage in physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week, with specific guidance on managing exercise-induced hypoglycemia.

**Complications:**  
No acute complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe hypoglycemia were observed during the hospital stay.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
1. **Medications:** Continue with prescribed insulin regimen. The patient has been educated on adjusting bolus insulin doses based on carbohydrate intake and blood glucose monitoring.
2. **Blood Glucose Monitoring:** Perform self-monitoring of blood glucose at least four times a day, including fasting, pre-meal, post-meal, and bedtime.
3. **Diet:** Follow the individualized meal plan focusing on balanced nutrition and carbohydrate counting.
4. **Exercise:** Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, with precautions to prevent hypoglycemia.
5. **Follow-up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with the endocrinology clinic in two weeks for medication adjustment and monitoring. Annual screenings for diabetic complications, including foot examinations, ophthalmologist evaluations for retinopathy, and urine tests for albuminuria, are recommended.

**Vaccinations:** Ensure up-to-date vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 as per the latest guidelines for patients with diabetes.
