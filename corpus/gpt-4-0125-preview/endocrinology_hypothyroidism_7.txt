**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: Jane Doe  
Age: 45  
Gender: Female  
MRN: 123456789  
Date of Admission: September 15, 2023  
Date of Discharge: September 25, 2023  
Primary Care Physician: Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology  

**Admission Summary:**  
Ms. Jane Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 15, 2023, with complaints of chronic fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance persisting for several months. Initial evaluation included a comprehensive metabolic panel, CBC, and thyroid function tests due to a suspicion of thyroid dysfunction.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **Thyroid Function Tests on Admission:**  
  - Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): 10.5 mIU/L (Normal: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L)  
  - Serum Free T4: 0.8 ng/dL (Normal: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL)  
  - Serum Triiodothyronine (T3): Normal  
- **CBC:** Normocytic normochromic anemia was noted with hemoglobin at 10.2 g/dL.  
- **Serum Cholesterol:** Elevated at 245 mg/dL.

Based on these results, Ms. Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism. Her elevated TSH and low free T4 levels confirmed the diagnosis, in line with established guidelines.

**Treatment and Management:**  
- **Levothyroxine Therapy:** Initiated at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, considering Ms. Doe's age and absence of heart disease. This dose aligns with the recommended starting dose for young or middle-aged healthy adults.
- **Follow-Up TSH and Free T4 Levels:** Scheduled for 6 weeks post-discharge to adjust the levothyroxine dosage as needed.

**Hospital Course:**  
Ms. Doe's symptoms began to improve gradually during her stay. Education was provided on the importance of adherence to levothyroxine therapy and the potential need for dosage adjustments based on follow-up lab results. She was also counseled on symptoms that should prompt immediate medical attention, such as increased heart rate, palpitations, or chest pain, which could indicate over-replacement of levothyroxine.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- **Medications:** Continue levothyroxine 100 mcg orally, once daily. The patient is advised not to miss doses and to take the medication on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.
- **Follow-Up:** Appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton in 6 weeks for repeat thyroid function tests and medication adjustment if necessary. Immediate follow-up is recommended if symptoms of hypothyroidism persist or worsen.
- **Diet and Exercise:** Encouraged to maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise routine to aid in overall well-being and weight management.
- **Special Instructions:** Alert healthcare providers about levothyroxine therapy before starting any new medications due to potential interactions.

**Precautions:**  
- Advise Ms. Doe of the importance of monitoring for signs of excessive thyroid hormone replacement, such as palpitations, restlessness, or significant weight loss.
- Importance of adherence to follow-up appointments for TSH and free T4 level monitoring to ensure optimal dosing of levothyroxine.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate levothyroxine therapy and follow-up, the prognosis for primary hypothyroidism is excellent. Ms. Doe's symptoms should continue to improve with adherence to treatment and follow-up care.
