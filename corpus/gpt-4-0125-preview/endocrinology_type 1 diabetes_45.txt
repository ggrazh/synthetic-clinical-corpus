**Summary of Hospital Stay:**

John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit of our hospital on September 15, 2023, with symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, sudden weight loss, and general fatigue. Given the clinical presentation, a series of diagnostic tests were initiated to confirm the suspicion of diabetes mellitus.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG): 250 mg/dL
- Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C): 9.8%
- Random Plasma Glucose: 280 mg/dL
- Autoantibodies associated with type 1 diabetes were present, confirming the type 1 diabetes diagnosis.

Based on these findings, John was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It was determined that immediate initiation of insulin therapy was necessary along with comprehensive diabetes education.

**Treatment and Management:**

John was started on a basal-bolus insulin regimen which included:
- Insulin Glargine 20 units at bedtime for basal coverage.
- Insulin Lispro, dosed according to carbohydrate intake and pre-meal blood glucose levels, averaging 8-10 units before meals.

Adjustments to insulin dosage were made during the stay to achieve glycemic targets. John responded well to the insulin therapy with stabilization of his blood glucose levels.

**Education:**
John received detailed education from our diabetes education team, which included:
- Understanding type 1 diabetes and its management.
- Recognizing signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
- Insulin administration techniques and the importance of compliance with the insulin regimen.
- Dietary recommendations focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates.
- The importance of physical activity and its impact on glucose control.
- Instruction on blood glucose monitoring and the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) if desired.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**

- **Medications upon Discharge:** 
    - Insulin Glargine 20 units at bedtime.
    - Insulin Lispro per sliding scale before meals.

- **Outpatient Follow-up:**
    - Follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton in 2 weeks to assess blood glucose logs and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
    - Annual screening for diabetic complications including comprehensive foot examination, funduscopic examination, and testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine.

    - Advised to monitor for signs of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia and report any severe episodes to healthcare provider immediately.

- **Vaccinations:**
    - Up-to-date with all recommended vaccinations for patients with diabetes, including influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

John was advised to maintain regular follow-up appointments with his endocrinologist and primary care physician to monitor his diabetes and adjust his management plan as necessary. He was also provided with contact information for diabetes support groups in his area.

**Discharge Condition:**
John was stable at the time of discharge, with an understanding of his diagnosis, treatment plan, and the importance of follow-up care. He demonstrated the ability to self-administer insulin and was competent in blood glucose monitoring.
