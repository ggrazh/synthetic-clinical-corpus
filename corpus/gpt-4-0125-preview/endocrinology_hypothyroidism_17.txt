**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**
- Name: Jane Doe
- Age: 45 years
- Sex: Female
- Admission Date: 15th September 2023
- Discharge Date: 25th September 2023
- Hospital ID: 987654321

**Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology

**Reason for Admission:**
The patient was admitted to the endocrinology unit with complaints of extreme fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. Past medical history included well-controlled hypertension and no known thyroid disorder.

**Significant Findings:**
Upon evaluation, physical examination revealed dry skin, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Initial laboratory tests showed elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at 10.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4 - 4.0 mIU/L) and low serum free T4 at 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9 - 1.7 ng/dL), indicating primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Anemia screening revealed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 245 mg/dL.

**Diagnosis:**
Primary hypothyroidism

**Treatment Initiated:**
- Levothyroxine was started at a dose of 100 mcg orally once daily, considering the patient's age and absence of heart disease.
- The patient was counseled on the importance of taking levothyroxine on an empty stomach and avoiding concurrent intake of calcium or iron supplements to enhance absorption.
- Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored to assess for potential adverse effects.

**Course of Hospital Stay:**
The patient responded well to the initiation of levothyroxine, with a notable improvement in energy levels and a slight decrease in symptoms of cold intolerance by the time of discharge. Repeat laboratory tests on 24th September 2023 showed a decrease in serum TSH levels to 6.7 mIU/L and an increase in serum free T4 to 0.9 ng/dL, indicating a positive response to therapy.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once daily. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks for repeat TSH and free T4 levels to adjust the dosage as necessary.
- Maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise.
- Report any new symptoms or side effects such as palpitations, chest pain, or increased anxiety to the healthcare provider immediately.
- Scheduled follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton on 6th November 2023 for further evaluation and management.

**Medications at Discharge:**
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once daily in the morning on an empty stomach.
- Continue antihypertensive medication as previously prescribed.

**Precautions:**
- Instructed to avoid rapid weight loss diets or over-the-counter supplements without consulting the healthcare provider, as these could interfere with thyroid hormone levels or absorption of levothyroxine.
- Advised on the signs of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in case the dose of levothyroxine needs adjustment.

**Summary:**
Jane Doe, a 45-year-old female, was admitted with symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism, confirmed by laboratory tests. Treatment with levothyroxine was initiated with significant clinical improvement. The patient has been advised on medication adherence, follow-up appointments, and symptom monitoring. Discharge planning included education on the chronic nature of hypothyroidism and the importance of regular monitoring and medication adjustment as needed.
