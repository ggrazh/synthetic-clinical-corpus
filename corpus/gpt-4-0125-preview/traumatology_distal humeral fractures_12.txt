### Patient Discharge Summary

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Age:** 35 years  
- **Sex:** Male  
- **Admission Date:** October 15, 2023  
- **Discharge Date:** November 5, 2023  
- **Hospital:** Saint Medical Traumatology Unit  
- **Attending Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton  

**Admission Information:**  
John Doe was admitted to the Traumatology Unit of Saint Medical Hospital on October 15, 2023, following a bicycle accident that resulted in severe pain and limited mobility in his right arm. Initial assessment in the Emergency Department highlighted significant swelling and tenderness around the elbow region.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
A true lateral x-ray of the elbow was performed immediately, revealing a posterior fat pad sign and deviation of the anterior humeral line from the middle of the capitellum, suggesting a posteriorly displaced distal humeral fracture. The radiocapitellar line did not bisect the capitellum, indicating an occult fracture. A complete neurovascular examination was conducted, showing no immediate signs of nerve damage or compromised blood flow.

**Treatment and Management:**  
Given the diagnosis of a displaced distal humeral fracture, the decision was made to proceed with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) surgery. The surgery was successfully performed on October 17, 2023, by Dr. Emily Stanton and her orthopedic team. Post-surgery, John was placed in a splint and started on a regimen for pain management and infection prevention:
- **Pain Management:** Acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain.
- **Infection Prevention:** Cefazolin 1 g IV every 8 hours for 24 hours post-operation.

**Hospital Course:**  
John's postoperative period was closely monitored for signs of infection, neurovascular complications, and healing. Physical therapy was initiated on October 20, 2023, focusing on gentle passive movements to promote joint mobility and prevent stiffness. John showed significant improvement in range of motion and reported decreased pain levels over the course of his stay.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- **Medications:** Continue Acetaminophen 1000 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for pain. Do not exceed 4000 mg in 24 hours.
- **Wound Care:** Keep the surgical site clean and dry. Follow-up with Dr. Stanton in one week for suture removal and wound assessment.
- **Activity:** Limit the use of the affected arm. Avoid lifting objects heavier than 5 pounds until cleared by an orthopedic surgeon.
- **Physical Therapy:** Continue outpatient physical therapy sessions twice a week for the next 6 weeks to improve strength and mobility.
- **Follow-Up Appointments:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Stanton on November 12, 2023, for an x-ray to assess healing progress and discuss further rehabilitation needs.

**Special Precautions:**  
- Monitor the surgical site for signs of infection, including increased redness, swelling, or discharge.
- Report any signs of decreased sensation or mobility in the affected limb to your healthcare provider immediately.

**Emergency Contact:**  
In case of fever, uncontrolled pain, or any concerns regarding the surgery site or arm function, contact Saint Medical Hospital's Emergency Department or return to the hospital immediately.

### Summary:  
John Doe was successfully managed for a posteriorly displaced distal humeral fracture sustained during a bicycle accident. Through timely surgical intervention and comprehensive postoperative care, he is on a positive trajectory towards recovery. Adherence to discharge instructions and follow-up care is crucial for optimal healing and restoration of function in the affected limb.
