Date of Admission: April 15, 2023  
Date of Discharge: April 25, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. [Physician's Name]  
Primary Diagnosis: Primary Hypothyroidism  

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**  
The patient was admitted to the endocrinology unit on April 15, 2023, with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Initial physical examination revealed dry skin, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes. The patient's medical history was notable for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, well-controlled on medication. No prior history of thyroid-related issues was reported.

**Diagnostic Testing:**  
On April 16, 2023, laboratory tests were conducted, including a complete blood count (CBC), serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) levels. The CBC showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia. The TSH level was significantly elevated at 15 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), and free T4 level was low at 0.5 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), confirming the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. T3 levels were within normal limits. Serum cholesterol was notably increased at 245 mg/dL. These findings were consistent with primary hypothyroidism.

**Treatment Initiated:**  
Levothyroxine therapy was initiated on April 17, 2023, at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, considering the patient's age and absence of heart disease. The patient was closely monitored for any adverse reactions or need for dose adjustments. Education on the importance of taking levothyroxine on an empty stomach and avoiding certain medications and supplements within 4 hours of dosing was provided.

**Response to Treatment:**  
By April 20, 2023, the patient reported a mild improvement in energy levels. No adverse cardiovascular events were noted. Given the patient's stable condition and positive initial response to levothyroxine, preparations for discharge began.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once daily in the morning on an empty stomach. The patient was counseled on the importance of adherence to therapy and follow-up blood tests to monitor TSH and free T4 levels.
- Continuation of pre-admission medications for hypertension and diabetes mellitus.

**Follow-Up:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the outpatient endocrinology clinic on May 10, 2023, for re-evaluation of thyroid function tests and potential levothyroxine dose adjustment based on those results. Additionally, routine monitoring of diabetes and hypertension will be performed.

**Summary and Recommendations:**  
The patient was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism during this hospital stay, confirmed by elevated TSH and low free T4 levels. Treatment with levothyroxine was initiated, and the patient showed initial improvement. It is critical for the patient to adhere to levothyroxine therapy and follow up as scheduled to ensure optimal management of hypothyroidism. Adjustments to the levothyroxine dose may be required based on thyroid function test results and clinical response. The patient was advised on lifestyle modifications to support overall health and manage the underlying conditions of hypertension and diabetes mellitus effectively.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
The patient was educated on recognizing signs of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, as dose adjustments might be necessary over time. Instructions were provided to immediately seek medical attention for symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, or unusual swelling. The importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise, was emphasized.
