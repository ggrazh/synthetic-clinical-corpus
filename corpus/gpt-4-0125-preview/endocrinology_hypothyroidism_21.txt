**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance persisting for several months.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient, a 45-year-old female, reported a gradual onset of fatigue, unexplained weight gain of approximately 10 kg over the past year, and increased sensitivity to cold. She also noted constipation and dry skin. There was no significant past medical history of thyroid disorders. However, she mentioned a family history of hypothyroidism in her mother.

**Physical Examination:**  
Upon admission, the patient appeared mildly edematous with dry skin. Vital signs were within normal limits. No goiter was palpated. Reflexes showed delayed relaxation.

**Laboratory Results at Admission:**  
- Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): 14 mIU/L (Normal: 0.5-4.5 mIU/L)  
- Serum Free T4: 0.7 ng/dL (Normal: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL)  
- Serum Total Triiodothyronine (T3): Normal  
- Complete Blood Count (CBC) showed mild normocytic normochromic anemia.  
- Serum cholesterol was elevated.

**Imaging:**  
Thyroid ultrasound showed no nodules or significant abnormalities.

**Diagnosis:**  
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the patient was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism.

**Treatment:**  
The patient was started on Levothyroxine to address her hypothyroidism. Considering her age and absence of heart disease, an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day was chosen. The patient was counseled on the importance of taking the medication in the morning on an empty stomach and not to eat for 30 minutes to improve absorption.

**Follow-up and Adjustments:**  
- On September 20, 2023, the patient reported a slight improvement in fatigue. Repeat labs showed a decrease in TSH to 10 mIU/L and an increase in free T4 to 0.9 ng/dL.  
- The dose of Levothyroxine was adjusted to 112 mcg orally once a day after reviewing the lab results and considering the patient's clinical response.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
1. **Medications:** Continue taking Levothyroxine 112 mcg orally once a day. The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to reassess symptoms and laboratory values, with potential further adjustment of Levothyroxine dosage.
2. **Diet and Lifestyle:** Encouraged a balanced diet rich in iodine and selenium. Advised regular exercise to aid in weight management.
3. **Monitoring:** The patient has been instructed to monitor and report any symptoms of over-replacement (such as palpitations, excessive sweating, and restlessness) or under-replacement (such as worsening fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance).
4. **Follow-up Appointment:** Scheduled for November 6, 2023, with Dr. [Redacted for Privacy] in the Endocrinology Unit. This visit will include a comprehensive review of symptoms, physical examination, and repeat thyroid function tests to determine if further dosage adjustments are necessary.

**Prognosis:**  
With appropriate treatment and monitoring, the patient's prognosis is excellent. Most symptoms of hypothyroidism will gradually improve with levothyroxine therapy, though it may take several weeks to months for full resolution.
