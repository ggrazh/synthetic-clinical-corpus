**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: Jane Doe  
Date of Birth: January 1, 1975  
MRN: 0123456789  
Admitting Date: September 15, 2023  
Discharge Date: September 22, 2023  
Admitting Diagnosis: Suspected Hypothyroidism  
Discharge Diagnosis: Primary Hypothyroidism  

**Hospital Course:**  
Jane Doe, a 48-year-old female with a past medical history notable for hypertension and a family history of thyroid disorders, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 15, 2023, presenting with fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance of several months' duration. On admission, her vital signs were stable, and physical examination revealed dry skin, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes. 

Given the clinical presentation, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels were obtained, revealing a TSH level of 15 mU/L (normal range: 0.5-4.5 mU/L) and a free T4 level of 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Anemia screening showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 240 mg/dL. 

Jane was started on levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day on September 16, 2023, considering her age and the absence of known heart disease. The importance of taking levothyroxine on an empty stomach was emphasized for optimal absorption. Jane was also advised on the potential need for dose adjustments based on future TSH and T4 levels, aiming for a TSH level within the target range.

During her stay, Jane's initial symptoms of hypothyroidism began to improve, and she reported feeling more energetic by the day of discharge. Her blood pressure and heart rate remained stable throughout her hospital stay. Jane did not exhibit any adverse reactions to the levothyroxine therapy.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once daily in the morning on an empty stomach.  
- Continue antihypertensive medications as prescribed prior to admission.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
Jane Doe is scheduled for follow-up in the endocrinology clinic in 6 weeks to reassess her symptoms, serum TSH, and free T4 levels. The goal is to adjust her levothyroxine dosage, if necessary, to achieve a euthyroid state. She has been advised to monitor her symptoms and report any signs of overtreatment such as palpitations, increased anxiety, or insomnia. Additionally, she was counseled on the importance of adherence to her levothyroxine therapy and to avoid taking calcium or iron supplements within 4 hours of her thyroid medication to prevent interference with absorption.

**Diet and Lifestyle Modifications:**  
Jane was counseled on adopting a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to manage her elevated cholesterol levels and support overall health. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking for 30 minutes most days of the week, was recommended to aid in weight management and cardiovascular health.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and has been initiated on levothyroxine therapy, with early signs of symptomatic improvement. With appropriate medication management and follow-up care, her prognosis is excellent for a return to euthyroid status and alleviation of symptoms.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Take levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once daily in the morning on an empty stomach.  
- Follow-up in the endocrinology clinic in 6 weeks or sooner if experiencing adverse symptoms.  
- Monitor and report any symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.  
- Continue with prescribed lifestyle modifications and dietary recommendations.
