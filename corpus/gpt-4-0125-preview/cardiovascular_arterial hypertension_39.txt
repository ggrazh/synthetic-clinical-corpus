**History of Present Illness:**
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on September 5, 2023, with complaints of severe headaches, episodes of dizziness, and blurred vision over the past two weeks. He has a known history of hypertension but had been non-compliant with his medication regimen and lifestyle recommendations. His family history is significant for cardiovascular disease, including hypertension and stroke.

**Physical Examination and Diagnostic Findings:**
Upon admission, Mr. Doe’s blood pressure was recorded at 158/94 mm Hg in both arms, with the left arm showing consistently higher readings. His body mass index (BMI) was recorded at 29.3 kg/m^2, indicating overweight status. A comprehensive physical examination and subsequent diagnostic tests, including urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and ECG, were performed. The results indicated no immediate target organ damage but raised concerns for potential future complications if the hypertension remained uncontrolled.

**Treatment and Management:**
Mr. Doe’s treatment was initiated with lifestyle modification counseling, including dietary changes aimed at reducing sodium intake to less than 1500 mg/day, encouraging weight loss, and increasing physical activity levels. Pharmacological treatment was initiated with Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg daily, and a thiazide diuretic, Hydrochlorothiazide, at a dose of 25 mg daily, considering his past medical history and the absence of contraindications for these medications.

**Hospital Course:**
During his hospital stay, Mr. Doe’s blood pressure showed a gradual improvement, stabilizing around 132/82 mm Hg. He participated in several educational sessions focusing on the importance of medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and self-monitoring of blood pressure. He demonstrated proficiency in measuring his blood pressure and expressed a commitment to adhere to the treatment plan.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Lisinopril 10 mg orally once daily.
- Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg orally once daily.
- Mr. Doe was advised to continue these medications without alteration until his follow-up appointment.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
