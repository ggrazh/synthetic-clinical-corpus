**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **MRN (Medical Record Number):** 0123456789  
- **Date of Birth:** January 1, 1970  
- **Date of Admission:** September 1, 2023  
- **Date of Discharge:** September 10, 2023  
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Thompson, MD, Endocrinology  
- **Primary Diagnosis:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**  
John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 1, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss over the past three months. His initial fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level was 240 mg/dL, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) was 9.8%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was not performed due to the clear diagnostic indicators from the FPG and HbA1C levels.

During his stay, John underwent comprehensive screening for diabetic complications. His foot examination revealed no signs of neuropathy or poor circulation, and a funduscopic examination showed no signs of diabetic retinopathy. Urine testing indicated no albuminuria. Serum creatinine and lipid profile were within normal limits, except for elevated LDL cholesterol levels, which were addressed during his stay.

**Medication Management:**  
- **Metformin:** Initiated at 500 mg twice daily, with meals. After tolerating this dose well for three days, it was increased to 1000 mg twice daily.
- **Semaglutide:** Started as a second-line therapy due to John's obesity and the need for weight loss, with an initial dose of 0.25 mg once weekly, titrated to 0.5 mg after one week, with plans to gradually increase to 2.4 mg based on tolerance and glycemic control.
- **Atorvastatin:** 20 mg daily was prescribed for LDL cholesterol management.

**Patient Education:**  
John received detailed education on the causes of type 2 diabetes, signs and symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and potential diabetic complications. He was counseled on the importance of monitoring blood glucose levels, adjusting insulin doses (if needed in the future), and carbohydrate intake. He received dietary counseling focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, personalized to accommodate his preferences and lifestyle. Physical activity recommendations were provided, emphasizing at least 150 minutes of aerobic and resistance exercise per week, with advice on monitoring and adjusting for hypoglycemia risk.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
John has been scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Thompson in four weeks to reassess his glycemic control, medication tolerability, and weight management progress. He was advised to monitor his blood glucose levels four times a day and keep a log of his readings. Adjustments to his medication regimen will be considered based on his follow-up labs and overall progress. Regular professional podiatric care was recommended, and vaccinations for Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 were updated during his stay.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
John was discharged with instructions to continue his medication regimen as prescribed, adhere to his diet and exercise plan, and monitor his blood glucose levels as advised. He was educated on the importance of seeking medical attention for signs of infection, significant changes in blood glucose levels, or any new symptoms suggesting diabetic complications.
