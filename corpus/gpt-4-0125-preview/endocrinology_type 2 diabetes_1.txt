- **Discharge Date:** September 20, 2023  
- **Hospital:** [Hospital Name], Endocrinology Unit  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient was admitted with complaints of persistent thirst, frequent urination, and recent unexplained weight loss.

**History of Present Illness:**  
The patient has been experiencing symptoms for approximately 3 months prior to admission, with a gradual onset and progressive worsening of symptoms. No prior diagnosis of diabetes in the patient's medical history.

**Diagnostic Assessment:**  
Upon admission, the following tests were conducted to evaluate the patient's condition:

- **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG):** 220 mg/dL
- **Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C):** 9.2%
- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):** Not performed due to conclusive FPG and HbA1C results
- **Random Glucose Test:** Conducted as part of initial screening, showing a glucose level of 210 mg/dL
- **Urine Test for Albuminuria:** Negative
- **Serum Creatinine:** Within normal limits
- **Lipid Profile:** Slightly elevated LDL cholesterol levels

Based on these results, the patient was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

**Treatment Initiated in Hospital:**  
- **Metformin:** Initiated with a dose of 500 mg twice daily, with plans to adjust based on patient tolerance and blood glucose monitoring results.
- **Dietary Counseling:** The patient received individualized dietary recommendations focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates.
- **Physical Activity Recommendations:** The patient was advised to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week, with additional resistance training exercises.
- **Patient Education:** Comprehensive education was provided covering the causes of diabetes, symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, management of diabetic complications, and the importance of regular monitoring and medication adherence.

**Follow-Up Care and Recommendations:**  
- **Medication Adjustment:** The patient is advised to follow up with their primary care physician within 2 weeks for potential adjustment of Metformin dosage based on blood glucose levels. The possibility of introducing GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors will be evaluated based on the patient's response to initial therapy and presence of any comorbid conditions.
- **Monitoring:** Regular monitoring of HbA1C every 3 months to assess the efficacy of the treatment plan.
- **Vaccinations:** The patient was updated on vaccinations, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, and advised on the importance of receiving vaccinations for hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2.
- **Podiatric Care:** Due to the importance of foot care in diabetes management, the patient was referred to a podiatrist for regular check-ups.
- **Weight Management:** The patient was counseled on the importance of weight management through diet, exercise, and potentially pharmacological interventions, including GLP-1 receptor agonists for weight loss if indicated.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
The patient has been provided with a glucose meter for regular monitoring of blood glucose levels at home. Instructions were given to adjust insulin or carbohydrate intake before physical activity to manage the risk of hypoglycemia effectively. The patient was also educated on recognizing signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and the appropriate actions to take in each scenario.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
The patient has been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and has initiated treatment with Metformin, dietary modifications, and physical activity. With adherence to the prescribed treatment plan and regular follow-up care, the patient's prognosis is favorable for managing diabetes and reducing the risk of complications.
