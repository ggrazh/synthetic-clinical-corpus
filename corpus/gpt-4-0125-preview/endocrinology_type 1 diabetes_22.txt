**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: [Patient Name]  
DOB: [Date of Birth]  
MRN: [Medical Record Number]  
Admission Date: September 20, 2023  
Discharge Date: September 27, 2023  
Attending Physician: Dr. [Physician's Name], MD, Endocrinology Unit

**Admission Summary:**  
The patient, a 24-year-old individual with no significant past medical history, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 20, 2023, with symptoms of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and recent unexplained weight loss. Initial assessment included a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) tests. The patient's FPG level was recorded at 250 mg/dL, and HbA1C was 11.0%, prompting further evaluation.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**  
Upon admission, the patient underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), which confirmed the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The OGTT 2-hour glucose level was 320 mg/dL. Autoantibody testing was positive for islet cell antibodies, further supporting the diagnosis. Random plasma glucose measures were consistently > 200 mg/dL during the hospital stay, confirming the need for insulin therapy. 

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient was educated extensively by a multidisciplinary team including an endocrinologist, a diabetes educator, and a nutritionist. Initial management focused on stabilizing the patient's glucose levels and introducing insulin therapy. A basal-bolus insulin regimen was initiated, consisting of:
- Insulin glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime for basal coverage.
- Insulin lispro 0.1 unit/kg before meals, adjusted according to carbohydrate intake and pre-meal blood glucose levels.

The patient was taught how to self-administer insulin, monitor blood glucose levels, and recognize the signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Nutritional counseling emphasized a diet rich in whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, tailored to the patient's preferences and lifestyle. The importance of regular physical activity was discussed, recommending at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise. The patient was advised to adjust insulin doses or carbohydrate intake as necessary to manage hypoglycemia risk during exercise.

During the hospital stay, the patient experienced one episode of mild hypoglycemia, which was promptly managed with oral glucose tablets. This served as a practical learning opportunity for recognizing and treating hypoglycemia. 

The patient underwent screening for diabetic complications, which included a comprehensive foot examination, funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist, and baseline tests for albuminuria and serum creatinine levels. All screening tests returned within normal limits.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Insulin glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime.
- Insulin lispro 0.1 unit/kg before meals, with dose adjustments based on carbohydrate intake and blood glucose monitoring.
- A prescription for a blood glucose monitoring kit, including a glucometer, test strips, and lancets.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. [Physician's Name] in the endocrinology clinic in two weeks to assess the effectiveness of the insulin regimen and make any necessary adjustments. Additionally, the patient will attend diabetes education sessions weekly for the next month to reinforce self-management skills. Annual screening for diabetic complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy, has been recommended.

**Patient Education:**
The patient received comprehensive education on the management of type 1 diabetes, including the importance of adherence to insulin therapy, diet, and exercise. The patient was also informed about the potential complications of diabetes and the necessity of regular medical follow-ups. Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 were updated according to the latest guidelines.

**Summary and Recommendations:**  
The patient was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus based on clinical presentation and diagnostic tests. Through a multidisciplinary approach, the patient was stabilized, educated, and initiated on insulin therapy. The patient demonstrated understanding and capability in self-managing diabetes by the time of discharge. It is crucial that the patient adheres to the recommended follow-up appointments, diabetes education sessions, and insulin regimen to manage their condition effectively and prevent complications.
