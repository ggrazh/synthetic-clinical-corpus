Summary of Hospital Stay:
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on 09/21/2023 with complaints of persistent headaches and episodes of dizziness. His initial blood pressure readings were 158/100 mm Hg in the right arm and 160/102 mm Hg in the left arm.

A targeted organ assessment was conducted, and no immediate damage was identified. Diagnostic testing included urinalysis, a complete lipid panel, comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and an ECG; all results were within normal limits except for elevated fasting plasma glucose levels.

Considering the guidelines for diagnosing and treating arterial hypertension, Mr. Doe's blood pressure was carefully monitored over several days using both hospital and ambulatory measurements to confirm the diagnosis of arterial hypertension.

Treatment During Hospital Stay:
Mr. Doe was started on a treatment regimen that included lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. He was prescribed Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, at an initial dose of 10 mg once daily. He received dietary counseling aimed at reducing his sodium intake to less than 1500 mg/day and was encouraged to increase his physical activity. A dietitian worked with Mr. Doe to create a personalized healthy eating plan.

Throughout his stay, Mr. Doe's blood pressure showed a gradual decrease and stabilized at 132/84 mm Hg. His understanding and commitment to lifestyle changes were evident, and he actively participated in his care plan.
