**Patient Name:** [Patient's Full Name]  
**DOB:** [DOB]  
**Admission Date:** October 15, 2023  
**Discharge Date:** October 22, 2023  
**Hospital:** [Hospital Name]  
**Department:** Endocrinology Unit  
**Attending Physician:** Dr. [Physician's Name]

**Reason for Admission:** Suspected hypothyroidism based on clinical symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation.

**History of Present Illness:**  
[Patient's Full Name], a [age]-year-old [male/female], presented to the endocrinology unit with a several-month history of increasing fatigue, noticeable weight gain despite no significant change in diet or exercise routine, cold intolerance, and constipation. These symptoms prompted a visit to their primary care physician, who after initial evaluation recommended further endocrinological assessment and potential hospital admission for comprehensive testing and management.

**Medical History:**  
- No previous history of thyroid diseases.  
- No known drug allergies.  
- Past medical history was otherwise unremarkable.

**Medications on Admission:**  
- No ongoing medications.

**Physical Examination:**  
- Vital signs were within normal limits on admission.  
- Physical examination revealed mild diffuse non-tender goiter.  
- No ophthalmopathy or dermopathy was noted.  
- Skin appeared dry.  
- Reflexes were normal.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- Serum TSH measurement upon admission was significantly elevated at 10.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L), indicating primary hypothyroidism.  
- Serum free T4 level was low at 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL).  
- Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits.  
- Complete blood count (CBC) showed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11 g/dL.  
- Serum cholesterol was elevated at 245 mg/dL.  
- Other routine laboratory tests including liver and kidney function tests were within normal limits.

**Treatment Initiated:**  
Based on the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, [Patient's Full Name] was started on levothyroxine therapy. Given the patient's age and absence of heart disease, an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day was prescribed on October 16, 2023. The decision on the dosage was based on the patient's clinical profile and the guidelines for treating hypothyroidism.

**Progress:**  
The patient tolerated the medication well with no adverse reactions. Within a few days of initiating levothyroxine, the patient reported a subjective improvement in energy levels and a slight improvement in cold intolerance. Constipation was managed with dietary recommendations.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue taking levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day. The patient was educated on the importance of taking the medication in the morning on an empty stomach for optimal absorption.  
- Follow-up appointment scheduled with Dr. [Physician's Name] in the endocrinology outpatient clinic on November 5, 2023, for repeat TSH and free T4 levels to adjust levothyroxine dosage if necessary.  
- Patient was advised to maintain a balanced diet rich in fiber to manage constipation and to stay hydrated.  
- Recommended routine checks for serum cholesterol in subsequent follow-up visits.  
- Patient was educated on the signs of over-replacement (e.g., palpitations, increased anxiety, insomnia) and under-replacement (e.g., worsening fatigue, continued weight gain) of thyroid hormone.  

**Special Considerations:**  
- The patient was counseled on the chronic nature of hypothyroidism and the likelihood of lifelong levothyroxine therapy.  
- Advised to notify any healthcare provider about levothyroxine therapy in case of surgery or new medication prescriptions to avoid interactions.  
- Informed about the importance of compliance with follow-up appointments for optimal management of hypothyroidism.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day.
