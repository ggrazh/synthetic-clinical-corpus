**1. Summary of Hospital Stay:**

John Doe, a 45-year-old male with no significant past medical history, presented to the emergency department on 10/05/2023 with a 3-day history of high fever, cough, body aches, and fatigue. Given the clinical presentation and the ongoing influenza outbreak in the community, influenza was highly suspected. On admission, his temperature was 39.2Â°C, heart rate 110 bpm, and respiratory rate 22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation was 94% on room air. Physical examination was notable for diffuse wheezing and decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes bilaterally. Initial laboratory tests were notable for leukopenia. A rapid antigen test for influenza was performed, yielding a positive result for Influenza A.

John was admitted to the infectious diseases unit for further management. RT-PCR test for influenza was conducted to confirm the strain and guide antiviral therapy, returning positive for Influenza A H3N2. Given the severity of symptoms and risk of complications, antiviral therapy was initiated. Chest X-ray was performed, revealing interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia. Pulse oximetry monitoring was initiated, and supportive care including hydration and antipyretics (excluding aspirin) was provided.

**2. Medications Administered:**

- **Oseltamivir**: 75 mg orally twice a day started on 10/05/2023 and continued for a total of 5 days. This medication was chosen due to the patient's ability to tolerate oral medication and the absence of contraindications.
  
- **Acetaminophen**: 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for fever and myalgia, started on 10/05/2023 and continued until fever resolved on 10/09/2023.

**3. Progress and Response to Treatment:**

John's clinical condition improved significantly over the course of his hospital stay. Fever resolved by 10/09/2023, and respiratory symptoms improved gradually. Repeat chest X-ray on 10/10/2023 showed resolution of interstitial infiltrates. Oxygen saturation improved to 98% on room air by 10/11/2023, and John was able to maintain stable vital signs without supplemental oxygen.

**4. Discharge Instructions:**

- **Medications**: Complete the prescribed course of Oseltamivir. Continue to use Acetaminophen as needed for any residual myalgia or low-grade fevers.
- **Activity**: Gradual return to normal activities as tolerated. Avoid strenuous activity until fully recovered.
- **Follow-up**: Schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician in 7-10 days or earlier if symptoms recur or worsen.
- **Prevention**: Annual influenza vaccination is recommended to prevent future infections.

**5. Precautions and Warning Signs:**

- Seek immediate medical attention if you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever, or confusion.
- Continue to practice good hygiene, including frequent handwashing and covering coughs and sneezes, to prevent the spread of influenza.

**6. Conclusion:**

John Doe was successfully treated for Influenza A with antiviral therapy and supportive care. He has been advised on preventive measures and is discharged in stable condition with instructions for follow-up and signs to watch for requiring immediate medical attention.
