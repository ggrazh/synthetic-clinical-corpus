**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: John Doe  
- Age: 45 years  
- Gender: Male  
- Admission Date: November 5, 2023  
- Discharge Date: November 12, 2023  
- Hospital ID: 00345789  

**Admission Information:**  
John Doe was admitted to the infectious diseases unit on November 5, 2023, with symptoms indicative of influenza, including high fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, and fatigue. Given the prevalence of influenza in the community and the onset of symptoms, clinical suspicion for influenza was high.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**  
Upon admission, a rapid antigen test was performed, yielding a positive result for Influenza A. To confirm the diagnosis and guide antiviral therapy, an RT-PCR test was conducted, which also returned positive for Influenza A. Considering Mr. Doe's severe respiratory symptoms, pulse oximetry was conducted, showing mild hypoxemia, and a chest x-ray was ordered. The chest x-ray revealed interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia, without evidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

**Treatment:**  
Given the RT-PCR confirmation of influenza and the onset of symptoms within the last 48 hours, antiviral therapy was initiated. Mr. Doe was started on Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, beginning on November 5, 2023, and continued for a total of 5 days. Symptomatic treatment for fever and body aches, excluding aspirin, was provided through the administration of acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for fever above 38.5Â°C. To address the mild hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula was provided, targeting an oxygen saturation >92%.

Hydration and rest were emphasized as part of the care plan. Due to the initial mild hypoxemia and the risk of progression, Mr. Doe was closely monitored with daily chest x-rays and pulse oximetry, which showed gradual improvement.

**Hospital Course:**  
During his hospital stay, Mr. Doe showed a favorable response to the antiviral therapy with a gradual decrease in fever, resolution of cough, and improvement in general well-being. His oxygen saturation levels stabilized, and supplemental oxygen was discontinued on November 8, 2023. Repeat RT-PCR for influenza on November 10, 2023, was negative, indicating the effective clearance of the virus. 

**Discharge Plan:**  
Mr. Doe was discharged on November 12, 2023, with instructions to continue resting at home and maintain adequate hydration. He was advised to avoid close contact with others for at least 24 hours after the resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications to prevent the spread of the virus. A follow-up appointment was scheduled for November 19, 2023, with his primary care physician to ensure the complete resolution of symptoms and address any residual effects of the illness.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, to complete a 5-day course.  
- Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for fever or discomfort.  

**Precautions:**  
Mr. Doe was educated on the importance of hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette to prevent the transmission of influenza to family members and others. He was advised to seek immediate medical attention if he experiences difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever, or signs of dehydration.

**Summary:**  
John Doe was admitted with symptoms consistent with influenza, confirmed by rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests. He was treated successfully with Oseltamivir and supportive care for his symptoms and mild hypoxemia. He was discharged in stable condition with advice for home care and follow-up.
