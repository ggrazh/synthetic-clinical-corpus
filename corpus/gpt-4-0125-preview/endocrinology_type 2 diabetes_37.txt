His vital signs upon admission were within normal limits except for elevated blood pressure (145/92 mmHg). His body mass index (BMI) was 30 kg/mÂ².

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG):** 220 mg/dL  
- **Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C):** 9.0%  
- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):** Not performed due to conclusive FPG and HbA1C results

- **Serum Creatinine:** 1.2 mg/dL  

**Diagnosis:**  
Based on the diagnostic findings, John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The elevated FPG and HbA1C levels were indicative of diabetes as per the guidelines. The presence of albuminuria suggested an early sign of diabetic nephropathy.

**Treatment Initiated:**  
- **Medications:**  
  - **Metformin:** Initiated at 500 mg twice daily, with plans to increase to 1000 mg twice daily after two weeks, considering gastrointestinal tolerability.  
  - **SGLT2 Inhibitor (Empagliflozin):** 10 mg once daily, in the morning.  
  - **Lisinopril:** 10 mg once daily for hypertension and nephroprotection.  
- **Diet:** Individualized dietary recommendations were provided, focusing on whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and reducing processed food intake.  
- **Exercise:** Encouraged at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week, along with resistance training exercises twice a week.  
- **Patient Education:** Comprehensive education was provided covering the causes of diabetes, the importance of monitoring blood glucose levels, recognizing signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and understanding diabetic complications. Dietary and exercise guidelines were also reiterated.

**Hospital Course:**  
John Doe's hospital stay involved daily blood glucose monitoring, diet adjustments, and the initiation of the aforementioned medication regimen. His blood glucose levels showed gradual improvement, and by September 19, 2023, his fasting blood glucose levels were consistently below 180 mg/dL. He tolerated the initial dose of metformin without significant gastrointestinal side effects. Empagliflozin was well-tolerated with no signs of urinary tract infections or significant diuresis. Blood pressure improved to 135/85 mmHg with lisinopril.

**Summary and Recommendations:**  
John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and has initiated treatment with metformin, empagliflozin, and lisinopril, along with lifestyle modifications. It is crucial to maintain the follow-up schedule for medication adjustments and monitoring of blood glucose levels. Continued patient education on managing diabetes, recognizing signs of complications, and maintaining lifestyle changes are essential for the management of his condition.
