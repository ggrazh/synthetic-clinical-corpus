**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**
Name: John Doe
Date of Birth: 01/01/1970
Medical Record Number: 123456
Date of Admission: 09/15/2023
Date of Discharge: 09/30/2023
Consulting Team: Endocrinology
Primary Consultant: Dr. Jane Smith, MD, Endocrinology
Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**
John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on 09/15/2023 with complaints of persistent thirst, frequent urination, and recent unexplained weight loss. Initial laboratory tests revealed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 220 mg/dL and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 9.2%, confirming the diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was not performed given the clear diagnostic criteria met through FPG and HbA1C levels.

Upon diagnosis, Mr. Doe was started on Metformin, 500 mg twice a day, as it is the first-line medication for Type 2 Diabetes due to its efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety profile. Given the high HbA1C level indicating poor glycemic control, a comprehensive diabetes education program was initiated, focusing on diet, exercise, and the importance of medication adherence.

Screening for diabetic complications was conducted, including a foot examination, which showed no signs of neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease, and a funduscopic examination, which was normal. Urine testing did not show albuminuria. Serum creatinine and lipid profile were within normal limits, but a lipid-lowering agent, Atorvastatin 20 mg daily, was started due to the increased cardiovascular risk associated with diabetes.

Dietary counseling was provided by a registered dietitian, emphasizing whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. Mr. Doe was advised to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with resistance training exercises. Adjustments for hypoglycemia risk during exercise were discussed.

Given Mr. Doe's initial HbA1C and the presence of obesity (BMI of 32), a GLP-1 receptor agonist, Semaglutide 1 mg weekly, was added to his regimen on 09/20/2023 to improve glycemic control and support weight loss efforts.

Throughout his stay, patient education was reinforced, covering the causes of diabetes, recognizing symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and understanding diabetic complications. Mr. Doe was also educated on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake, though insulin therapy was not initiated during this admission as Metformin and Semaglutide were deemed appropriate for his level of glycemic control.

Mr. Doe was vaccinated against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 during his stay to reduce the risk of infections.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue Metformin 500 mg twice daily and Semaglutide 1 mg weekly.
- Follow the individualized dietary plan focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates.
- Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with resistance training.
- Monitor blood glucose levels as advised and adjust medication as necessary under the guidance of the endocrinology team.
- Attend follow-up appointments with Dr. Jane Smith in two weeks for medication adjustment and glycemic control assessment.
- Report any signs of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia immediately to the healthcare provider.
- Continue other medications as prescribed and complete all vaccinations if not already administered during the hospital stay.

**Follow-Up Care:**
Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. Jane Smith on 10/14/2023 to assess his response to the treatment regimen and make necessary adjustments. Further laboratory tests will be conducted at this visit, including FPG, HbA1C, and a lipid profile to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and adherence to the medication.

**Conclusion:**
John Doe was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus during his admission and has been started on an appropriate treatment regimen, including Metformin, Semaglutide, and Atorvastatin, along with comprehensive diabetes education. He has been discharged in stable condition with instructions for follow-up care and management strategies for his diabetes.
