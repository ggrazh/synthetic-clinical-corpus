Patient Discharge Summary

**Patient Details:**
- Name: Jane Doe
- Age: 45 years
- Sex: Female
- Hospital ID: 9876543
- Admission Date: September 15, 2023
- Discharge Date: September 25, 2023
- Attending Physician: Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology
- Discharge Diagnoses: Primary Hypothyroidism

**History and Presenting Complaints:**
Jane Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 15, 2023, with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance over the past 6 months. She had also noticed thinning hair and dry skin. There was no significant past medical history or family history of thyroid disorders.

**Investigations and Findings:**
Upon admission, blood tests were conducted, revealing a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 10.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.5-4.5 mIU/L) and a serum free T4 level of 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Serum free T3 levels were within normal limits. Anemia was detected, with a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, and was normocytic-normochromic. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 245 mg/dL. These findings supported the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism.

**Treatment Initiated:**
Jane was started on levothyroxine, with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, considering her age and absence of heart disease. The dose was chosen to closely match the guideline recommendation of 1.7 mcg/kg/day for young or middle-aged healthy patients. The importance of taking levothyroxine on an empty stomach and not within an hour of eating to enhance absorption was emphasized.

**Progress and Monitoring:**
Jane's symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance began to improve within two weeks of starting levothyroxine. TSH and free T4 levels were monitored closely. On September 22, a follow-up blood test showed a decrease in TSH to 4.2 mIU/L and an increase in free T4 to 1.0 ng/dL, indicating an improvement but necessitating a slight adjustment in levothyroxine dosage. The dose was adjusted to 112 mcg orally once a day.

**Discharge and Recommendations:**
Jane was discharged on September 25 with instructions to continue levothyroxine at the adjusted dose of 112 mcg daily. She was educated on the signs of both over-replacement (anxiety, insomnia, palpitations, weight loss) and under-replacement (fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance) of thyroid hormone. Jane was scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks for repeat thyroid function tests and a consultation to ensure the adequacy of hormone replacement and dose adjustment if necessary.

**Medications at Discharge:**
- Levothyroxine 112 mcg orally once a day in the morning on an empty stomach

**Follow-up Appointments:**
- Endocrinology follow-up with Dr. Emily Stanton on November 6, 2023, for evaluation of symptoms and thyroid function tests.

**Special Instructions:**
- Jane was advised to avoid rapid weight loss diets as they can affect thyroid hormone levels and medication needs.
- She was informed about the importance of adhering to the prescribed levothyroxine dose and not to miss doses.
- Jane was educated on the potential interaction of levothyroxine with other medications and supplements, especially calcium and iron supplements, and was advised to take these at least 4 hours apart from her thyroid medication.

**Emergency Instructions:**
- Jane was advised to seek immediate medical attention if she experiences symptoms of myxedema coma, such as extreme fatigue, cold intolerance, confusion, or unconsciousness, although rare.
