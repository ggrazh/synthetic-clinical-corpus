- **Serum Creatinine:** 1.0 mg/dL  
- **Lipid Profile:** Elevated LDL and triglycerides

Based on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient was initially managed with dietary modifications and exercise recommendations. Metformin was started at a dose of 500 mg twice daily, which was well tolerated by the patient. After three days, due to persistent hyperglycemia, the dose was increased to 1000 mg twice daily. Education on the importance of monitoring blood glucose levels, recognizing symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and the potential complications of diabetes was provided. The patient was also counseled on the importance of regular physical activity and dietary control focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. A consultation with a nutritionist and a physical therapist was arranged.

Given the patient's elevated HbA1C and the presence of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, a comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment was conducted, and the patient was started on a statin for lipid control. An ACE inhibitor was initiated for hypertension and to provide renal protection. 

In addition to metformin, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, was initiated at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly, with plans to titrate based on tolerance and glycemic control, aiming for a dose of 2.4 mg for weight loss and improved glycemic control.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Metformin 1000 mg twice daily  
- Semaglutide 0.25 mg once weekly, with titration instructions  
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg daily  

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**  
The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic in 4 weeks to assess glycemic control, tolerance to medications, and adherence to lifestyle modifications. Continued monitoring of HbA1C, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profile, and renal function tests every 3 months was recommended. The patient was educated on the importance of adherence to medication, diet, and exercise regimens. Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 were administered during the hospital stay. The patient was advised on the importance of regular podiatric care and to seek medical attention for any signs of foot injury or infection.

**Special Instructions:**  
Adjustments to insulin or carbohydrate intake before exercise to avoid hypoglycemia were discussed. The patient was provided with detailed education on adjusting semaglutide doses based on blood glucose levels, appetite, and potential gastrointestinal side effects. The patient was advised to slowly increase physical activity to at least 150 minutes per week, incorporating both aerobic and resistance exercise.

**Prognosis:**  
With adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up, the patient has a favorable prognosis for managing type 2 diabetes and reducing the risk of complications.
