**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- Name: John Doe  
- Age: 45 years  
- Sex: Male  
- Admission Date: September 20, 2023  
- Discharge Date: September 30, 2023  
- Hospital: Saint Health Endocrinology Unit  

**Initial Presentation and Diagnosis:**  
Mr. John Doe presented to the emergency department on September 20, 2023, with symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and cold intolerance. Blood tests were performed, revealing elevated serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels at 10.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and low serum free T4 levels at 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), indicative of primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Anemia was noted, with hemoglobin at 9.5 g/dL, described as normocytic-normochromic. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 245 mg/dL. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was made.

**Management and Treatment:**  
Mr. Doe was started on Levothyroxine, initiating therapy at 100 mcg orally once a day, in accordance with guidelines for young or middle-aged healthy patients. Given his age and absence of heart disease, this starting dose was deemed appropriate. His symptoms and TSH levels were closely monitored throughout his hospital stay.

**Follow-up Tests and Adjustments:**  
A follow-up blood test on September 25, 2023, showed a decrease in TSH levels to 7.0 mIU/L and an increase in free T4 to 0.9 ng/dL, indicating an improvement but still outside the desired range. Consequently, his Levothyroxine dose was adjusted to 125 mcg orally once a day.

**Progress and Discharge Plan:**  
By September 30, 2023, Mr. Doe reported significant improvement in symptoms, including increased energy levels and improved bowel movements. His weight began to stabilize, and he reported feeling less cold intolerance. Given the clinical improvement and stable vital signs, Mr. Doe was discharged with instructions to continue Levothyroxine at 125 mcg/day. He was advised to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks for a repeat TSH and free T4 level test, to ensure levels continue to normalize. Adjustments to his Levothyroxine dose will be based on these results.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levothyroxine 125 mcg orally once a day. The patient was counseled on the importance of taking the medication in the morning on an empty stomach and not eating for at least 30 minutes after administration.

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- Advised to maintain a balanced diet rich in iodine and selenium.  
- Encouraged regular exercise to help manage weight and improve overall well-being.  
- Recommended to avoid consuming soy products and high-fiber foods close to Levothyroxine intake, as they can interfere with medication absorption.

**Follow-up Care:**  
- Outpatient follow-up appointment scheduled with Endocrinology on October 14, 2023, for evaluation of thyroid function tests and possible medication adjustment.  
- Primary care physician follow-up within two weeks for interim assessment and to address any concerns.

**Special Precautions:**  
- The patient was educated on the signs of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, to monitor for symptoms indicating under or over-replacement with Levothyroxine.  
- Instructed to seek immediate medical attention if experiencing chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath.

**Conclusion:**  
Mr. John Doe's hospitalization for the management of primary hypothyroidism concluded with notable improvement in clinical symptoms and partial normalization of thyroid function tests. Ongoing management with Levothyroxine, close monitoring, and follow-up care are critical to achieving optimal thyroid function and preventing potential complications associated with hypothyroidism.
