Discharge Date: September 20, 2023  
Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  

**History of Present Illness:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 12, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss over the past 3 months. His initial fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was recorded at 220 mg/dL, and his glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 9.0%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon admission, Mr. Doe underwent comprehensive evaluation including oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), which indicated significant insulin resistance. A complete foot examination and funduscopic examination were conducted, revealing no immediate signs of diabetic complications. Urine testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine measurements indicated normal kidney function, and the lipid profile was within acceptable limits albeit with elevated triglycerides.

Given the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, a multifaceted treatment approach was initiated focusing on medication, lifestyle modification, and patient education. Metformin was started at a dose of 500 mg twice daily, which was well tolerated and gradually increased to 1000 mg twice daily by the end of his hospital stay without any significant gastrointestinal side effects. Education on dietary changes, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, was provided. The importance of physical activity was emphasized, recommending at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly.

Mr. Doe was also introduced to self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, with detailed education on recognizing symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 were administered during his stay, considering the increased risk associated with diabetes.

**Medications at Discharge:**
- Metformin 1000 mg orally, twice daily
- Patient education reinforced on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake if needed in the future.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
- Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up visit in the endocrinology clinic on October 5, 2023, to reassess his HbA1c, adjust medications if necessary, and review his progress with lifestyle modifications.
- Continuation of dietary recommendations as advised by the dietician, focusing on whole foods and balancing macronutrients.
- Maintain physical activity as tolerated, with adjustments for hypoglycemia risk.
- Podiatric care appointment scheduled for October 15, 2023, to assess foot health and provide education on foot care.
- Mr. Doe was educated on the importance of regular monitoring for signs of diabetic complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy.

**Discharge Instructions:**
Mr. Doe has been advised to strictly adhere to the prescribed medication regimen and lifestyle modifications. He has been educated on the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring and how to adjust his lifestyle based on the readings. The importance of attending all scheduled follow-up appointments has been stressed to ensure optimal management of his diabetes and to prevent complications.

**Summary:**
Mr. John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on elevated fasting plasma glucose levels and HbA1c. He was managed with metformin, lifestyle modifications, and comprehensive patient education. Mr. Doe showed understanding and commitment to managing his condition and is scheduled for follow-up to monitor his progress.
