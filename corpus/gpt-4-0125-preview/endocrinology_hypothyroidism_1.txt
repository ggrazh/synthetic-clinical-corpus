Based on clinical presentation and laboratory results, the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was made.

**Hospital Course:**  
The patient was initiated on levothyroxine therapy starting at a dose of 100 mcg orally once daily, considering her age and absence of heart disease. The decision was based on the guidelines for treating hypothyroidism, targeting a normalization of TSH and alleviation of symptoms. The patient was closely monitored for any adverse reactions to the medication, with particular attention to symptoms of over-replacement such as palpitations or increased anxiety.

**Adjustments in Treatment:**  
On September 20, 2023, a repeat serum TSH level indicated a decrease to 8.5 mIU/L, suggesting an improvement but still above the target range. The levothyroxine dose was adjusted to 125 mcg daily after this result.

**Education:**  
The patient received education regarding hypothyroidism, including the importance of adherence to medication, potential side effects, and the need for regular follow-up blood tests to monitor thyroid function. Dietary and lifestyle advice was provided to assist with weight management and overall well-being. The importance of medication adjustments during illness or if other medications are added was discussed.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levothyroxine 125 mcg orally once daily  
- Lisinopril 20 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 10 mg nightly  

**Follow-Up:**  
Jane Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks with the endocrinology unit to re-evaluate her symptoms and adjust the levothyroxine dosage if necessary. A repeat of thyroid function tests will be done one week prior to the appointment.

**Instructions for Patient:**  
- Continue taking the prescribed medications without interruption.  
- Be aware of symptoms of both under and over-replacement of thyroid hormone.  
- Report any symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, or unusual fatigue.  
- Maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise regimen.

**Discharge Condition:**
