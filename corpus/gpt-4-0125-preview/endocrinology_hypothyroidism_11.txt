**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Name:** [John Doe]  
**MRN:** [XXXXXX]  
**Date of Birth:** [MM/DD/YYYY]  
**Admission Date:** September 15, 2023  
**Discharge Date:** September 25, 2023  
**Consulting Physician:** Dr. [Name], Endocrinology Unit  

**Reason for Admission:**  
Patient presented to the emergency department on September 15, 2023, with symptoms of extreme fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Given the clinical presentation, an endocrinological evaluation was initiated.

**History of Present Illness:**  
[John Doe] is a [Age]-year-old [male/female] with no significant past medical history except for controlled hypertension. Over the past 3-4 months, [he/she] noticed a gradual onset of fatigue, unintentional weight gain of approximately 10 kg, increased sensitivity to cold, and constipation. [He/She] denied any previous thyroid issues, surgeries, or family history of thyroid diseases.

**Diagnostic Assessment:**  
Upon admission, laboratory tests were ordered, including a complete blood count (CBC), serum cholesterol, and thyroid function tests. The CBC revealed a normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 240 mg/dL. The most significant findings came from the thyroid panel, which showed an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 14 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and a low serum free T4 level of 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), consistent with a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) was within normal limits.

**Management and Treatment:**  
Given the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, [John Doe] was started on Levothyroxine therapy. An initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day was prescribed, based on [his/her] age and the absence of known heart disease. [His/Her] symptoms and thyroid function tests were closely monitored during the hospital stay.

**Hospital Course:**  
[John Doe]'s condition showed gradual improvement with Levothyroxine therapy. By September 23, [he/she] reported significant alleviation of fatigue and cold intolerance. A follow-up thyroid function test on September 24 indicated an improvement in free T4 levels to 1.1 ng/dL, though the TSH level remained slightly elevated at 8 mIU/L, suggesting the need for dose adjustment.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Levothyroxine 112 mcg orally once a day, to be taken in the morning on an empty stomach. The dosage was adjusted based on the latest thyroid function test results.
- Continue [other medications for hypertension or any other condition].

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
1. Outpatient follow-up with Dr. [Name], Endocrinology, within 2 weeks for repeat thyroid function tests and further dose adjustment of Levothyroxine as needed.
2. Monitor symptoms of hypothyroidism and report any worsening or new symptoms immediately.
3. Continue to take Levothyroxine on an empty stomach, preferably in the morning, for optimal absorption.
4. Annual screening for cholesterol levels, given the initial presentation of elevated serum cholesterol.

**Specific Instructions:**  
- Educate [John Doe] on the importance of medication adherence and regular monitoring of thyroid function.
- Advise on a balanced diet and regular exercise as part of overall health maintenance.
- Discuss potential side effects of Levothyroxine, including symptoms of over-replacement such as palpitations, anxiety, or insomnia. Instruct [him/her] to report these symptoms if they occur.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
[John Doe] was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and has responded well to initial treatment with Levothyroxine. With appropriate dose adjustments and monitoring, [his/her] prognosis is excellent. Continuous follow-up in the endocrinology clinic is crucial to ensure optimal management of [his/her] condition.
