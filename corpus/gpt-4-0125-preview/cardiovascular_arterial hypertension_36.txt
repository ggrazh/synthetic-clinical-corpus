Mr. John Doe, a 53-year-old male with a past medical history significant for obesity and a family history of cardiovascular disease, was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on 09/15/2023 with complaints of severe headaches and episodes of dizziness over the past two weeks. Blood pressure on admission was recorded at 160/100 mm Hg in both arms. Following the guidelines for hypertension management, blood pressure measurements were taken three times at different intervals, confirming a diagnosis of arterial hypertension with an average reading of 158/98 mm Hg.

Given the patient's history and initial presentation, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted, including urinalysis, a lipid panel, a metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and an ECG. The thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within normal limits. No significant abnormalities were noted except for elevated LDL cholesterol levels and a fasting plasma glucose indicative of prediabetes. Physical examination revealed a BMI of 32, a waist circumference of 102 cm, and no signs of target organ damage.

Mr. Doe was initiated on lifestyle modifications, including a diet plan aimed at weight loss, a reduction in sodium intake to less than 1500 mg/day, and a regimen of increased physical activity. Pharmacological treatment was started with Lisinopril 10 mg once daily and Amlodipine 5 mg once daily to manage his hypertension.

Throughout his hospital stay, Mr. Doe's blood pressure steadily improved, reaching a target of 132/82 mm Hg by the time of discharge. The importance of medication adherence, regular blood pressure monitoring at home, and lifestyle modifications were extensively discussed with the patient. He demonstrated understanding of the long-term nature of hypertension management and scheduled a follow-up appointment in the hypertension clinic in 4 weeks for reassessment.
