**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: Jane Doe  
Age: 45  
Sex: Female  
Admission Date: September 15, 2023  
Discharge Date: September 25, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Emily Stanton, Endocrinology  
Primary Diagnosis: Primary Hypothyroidism  

**History and Physical Examination:**  
Jane Doe presented to the endocrinology unit with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance persisting over the past six months. Physical examination revealed dry skin, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes. Her initial vital signs were within normal limits except for a heart rate of 55 bpm. The patient's medical history includes controlled hypertension and no known drug allergies. There was no significant family history of thyroid or autoimmune diseases.

**Laboratory Findings and Imaging:**  
Blood tests conducted on September 15, 2023, showed elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) at 12.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and low serum free T4 at 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), confirming the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Anemia was noted with a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, characterized as normocytic-normochromic. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 245 mg/dL. An ultrasound of the thyroid gland indicated a homogeneous gland without nodules or enlargement.

**Treatment and Medication:**  
Jane Doe was started on levothyroxine, with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, considering her age and the absence of known heart disease. This dosage aimed to normalize her TSH and free T4 levels gradually. Her blood pressure and heart rate were monitored closely during her stay to adjust the medication if needed and to avoid potential cardiac issues due to the treatment.

**Progress and Response to Treatment:**  
The patient's symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance began to improve within a week of starting levothyroxine. Repeat blood tests on September 24, 2023, showed a decrease in TSH to 6.8 mIU/L and an increase in free T4 to 0.9 ng/dL, indicating an appropriate response to the medication. The dosage of levothyroxine was maintained at 100 mcg once daily. Jane reported feeling significantly better and was able to participate in regular activities without excessive fatigue.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
Jane Doe was discharged on September 25, 2023, with instructions to continue levothyroxine 100 mcg once daily. She was advised to:
- Monitor her symptoms and report any recurrence of fatigue, weight changes, or intolerance to cold.
- Follow up with Dr. Emily Stanton in four weeks for a repeat TSH and free T4 levels test to adjust the levothyroxine dosage if necessary.
- Maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise.
- Monitor her blood pressure and heart rate at home and report any significant changes.
- Avoid taking calcium and iron supplements within four hours of levothyroxine to prevent interference with medication absorption.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
Jane is scheduled for a follow-up appointment on October 23, 2023, with Dr. Emily Stanton. This visit will include a comprehensive review of her symptoms, medication side effects, and a repeat blood test to ensure the adequacy of the levothyroxine dosage and the normalization of TSH and free T4 levels.

**Emergency Instructions:**  
The patient was instructed to seek immediate care if she experiences symptoms of myxedema coma, such as extreme fatigue, hypothermia, or unresponsiveness, although this is rare.

**Summary:**  
Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism and treated successfully with levothyroxine. Her discharge plan includes ongoing medication, monitoring of symptoms, and follow-up care to ensure optimal management of her condition.
