**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Age:** 58 years  
- **Sex:** Male  
- **Admission Date:** September 15, 2023  
- **Discharge Date:** October 5, 2023  
- **Hospital:** General Hospital, Neurology Unit  
- **Consulting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton  

**Admission Summary:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the General Hospital's Neurology Unit on September 15, 2023, with a sudden onset of severe headache, right-sided weakness, and impaired consciousness. The patient has a history of hypertension and was on regular medication (Lisinopril 20 mg daily). There was no history of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication use.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
Upon admission, bedside blood glucose levels were measured, ruling out hypoglycemia. A complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation studies, including INR, PTT, and platelet count, were within normal limits. Immediate CT imaging of the brain revealed a left intracerebral hemorrhage measuring 4 cm in diameter. CT angiography did not demonstrate the 'spot sign,' indicating no ongoing bleeding at the time of imaging.

**Treatment and Management:**  
Given the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage, anticoagulants and antiplatelet medications were contraindicated. Blood pressure management was initiated immediately with IV nicardipine, starting at 2.5 mg/hour and gradually increased to a maximum of 10 mg/hour, achieving a target blood pressure of 140/85 mm Hg. This protocol was maintained throughout the patient's stay to avoid high blood pressure peaks and variability.

The neurosurgical evaluation determined that given the location and size of the hemorrhage, surgical intervention was not indicated, aligning with the guidelines that deep cerebral hematomas and certain lobar hematomas have high surgical mortality and morbidity. The patient was closely monitored for any signs of hydrocephalus or need for surgical evacuation.

**Complications:**  
Mr. Doe experienced a mild, transient episode of hypotension (BP 110/65 mm Hg) on September 20, which was managed with IV fluid resuscitation and temporary reduction of the nicardipine infusion rate. No episodes of seizure were observed during the hospital stay.

**Recovery and Rehabilitation:**  
The patient's neurological status gradually improved over the course of the hospital stay. Physical therapy and occupational therapy were initiated early to assist with right-sided weakness. By the time of discharge, Mr. Doe demonstrated significant improvement in motor strength and was able to perform daily activities with minimal assistance.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- **Lisinopril 20 mg orally once daily** for hypertension.  
- **Nicardipine IV infusion was discontinued upon discharge, with instructions to monitor blood pressure closely.**  
- **No antiseizure medications were prescribed, as the patient did not experience any seizures during hospitalization.**

**Follow-Up Care:**  
Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton in the neurology clinic on October 20, 2023. This appointment aims to reassess neurological function, blood pressure management, and overall recovery progress. Additionally, a repeat CT scan of the brain is scheduled for November 5, 2023, to evaluate the resolution of the hemorrhage. Continued physical and occupational therapy is recommended to further aid in recovery.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Monitor blood pressure at home twice daily.  
- Adhere strictly to the prescribed medication regimen.  
- Continue with outpatient physical and occupational therapy.  
- Be alert for signs of recurrent stroke, such as sudden onset of headache, weakness, or changes in level of consciousness, and seek immediate medical attention if these occur.  
- Maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle to manage hypertension.

**Patient Education:**  
The patient and his family were educated about the importance of blood pressure management, the risks associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, and the significance of adhering to the rehabilitation program. Instructions were given on how to monitor blood pressure at home and the importance of regular follow-up appointments.

**Summary:**  
Mr. John Doe's hospital course was complicated by a significant intracerebral hemorrhage. Through vigilant medical and surgical management, coupled with rehabilitation efforts, his condition improved. He is discharged with specific follow-up care instructions to ensure continued recovery and monitoring for any potential complications.
