**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
Name: John Doe  
Age: 35 years  
Gender: Male  
Date of Admission: October 5, 2023  
Date of Discharge: October 15, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Emily Peterson, MD, Orthopedics and Traumatology Unit  
Primary Diagnosis: Distal Humeral Fractures  
Secondary Issues: None identified  

**History and Presenting Complaints:**  
John Doe was admitted to the hospital on October 5, 2023, following a fall from a ladder at his home, landing directly on his outstretched right arm. He presented with severe pain, swelling, and limited mobility in the right elbow. Initial evaluation revealed a positive posterior fat pad sign on a true lateral x-ray of the elbow, suggesting joint effusion and a possible occult fracture.

**Diagnostic Findings:**  
- A true lateral x-ray of the elbow showed a posterior fat pad sign, highly indicative of an occult fracture.
- The anterior humeral line on the x-ray did not transect the middle of the capitellum, suggesting a posteriorly displaced distal humeral fracture.
- The radiocapitellar line did not bisect the capitellum, further indicating the presence of an occult fracture.
- A complete neurovascular examination was performed, revealing no immediate nerve damage or vascular injury.

**Treatment Summary:**  
Given the diagnosis of a displaced distal humeral fracture, the decision was made to proceed with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF). The surgery was successfully performed on October 6, 2023, by Dr. Emily Peterson and her team. Post-surgery, John was started on a regimen for pain management and infection prevention, which included:
- Ibuprofen 400 mg orally every 8 hours for pain and inflammation.
- Acetaminophen 1,000 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for additional pain control.
- Cephalexin 500 mg orally every 6 hours for 7 days to prevent postoperative infection.

**Hospital Course:**  
John's postoperative period was closely monitored for signs of infection, complications from the surgery, and neurovascular status. Physical therapy was initiated on October 8, 2023, focusing on gentle passive range of motion exercises to prevent stiffness and promote healing. John showed satisfactory progress in regaining mobility, with mild to moderate pain managed effectively with the prescribed medications.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue with oral antibiotics (Cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours) until the course is completed.
- Pain management with Ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours and Acetaminophen 1,000 mg every 6 hours as needed. Do not exceed the recommended doses.
- Keep the surgical site clean and dry. Instructions on wound care and dressing changes were provided.
- Follow-up with Dr. Emily Peterson in 1 week for suture removal and to evaluate the healing process. Further appointments will be scheduled as needed.
- Gradually increase physical therapy exercises as tolerated, focusing on strengthening and increasing the range of motion. A referral to a specialized physical therapist was provided.
- Seek immediate medical attention if signs of infection, increased pain, or any neurovascular changes occur.

**Prognosis:**  
John's prognosis is good, with expectations for a full recovery. Adherence to the prescribed medication regimen, wound care instructions, and physical therapy program is crucial for optimal healing and recovery.

**Follow-Up Care:**  
John is scheduled for a follow-up visit on October 22, 2023, with Dr. Emily Peterson to monitor his recovery progress. Further follow-ups will be scheduled as necessary to ensure complete healing and functionality of the elbow joint.

**Patient Education:**  
John was educated on the importance of following the discharge instructions, especially adhering to the medication schedule, wound care, and physical therapy exercises. He was also informed about the signs and symptoms of potential complications that should prompt immediate medical consultation.
