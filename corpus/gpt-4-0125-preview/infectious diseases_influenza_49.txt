**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Name:** [John Doe]  
**Patient ID:** [123456789]  
**Date of Admission:** [April 5, 2023]  
**Date of Discharge:** [April 12, 2023]  
**Admitting Physician:** [Dr. Jane Smith]  
**Department:** [Infectious Diseases Unit]  

**Reason for Admission:**  
John Doe, a 45-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital with a 3-day history of high fever, cough, muscle aches, and severe fatigue. Influenza was suspected due to the presence of these symptoms during a local outbreak.

**History and Physical Examination:**  
Upon admission, the patient presented with a temperature of 39.5Â°C, heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. Physical examination revealed bilateral rhonchi with decreased breath sounds in the lower lobes. The rest of the examination was unremarkable.

**Diagnostic Workup:**  
Rapid antigen test for influenza was performed, yielding a positive result for Influenza A. Given the patient's severe symptoms and the need for hospitalization, an RT-PCR test was also conducted, confirming Influenza A H1N1 subtype. Chest X-ray was performed to rule out pneumonia, which showed clear lung fields without evidence of infiltrates, indicating no secondary bacterial pneumonia. Pulse oximetry indicated mild hypoxemia.

**Treatment and Management:**  
The patient was started on antiviral therapy with Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day within 24 hours of admission, for a total duration of 5 days. Given the initial presentation of hypoxemia, supplemental oxygen was provided via nasal cannula, which was gradually tapered off as the patient's oxygen saturation levels improved.

Symptomatic management included administration of acetaminophen for fever and muscle aches, and adequate hydration was maintained. Aspirin was avoided due to the patient's age and the associated risk of Reye's syndrome. The patient was closely monitored for signs of secondary bacterial infection, but none developed during the hospital stay.

**Progress:**  
The patient showed marked improvement over the course of the hospital stay. Fever resolved by day 3 post-admission, and cough and fatigue gradually improved. Oxygen therapy was discontinued by day 4, and the patient continued to recover uneventfully. Repeat chest X-ray on day 5 showed no abnormalities, and the patient was considered stable for discharge.

**Discharge Plan:**  
John Doe was discharged on [April 12, 2023] with instructions to continue resting at home, maintain adequate hydration, and complete the prescribed course of Oseltamivir. A follow-up appointment with Dr. Jane Smith is scheduled for [April 19, 2023], to ensure complete recovery. The patient was advised to seek immediate medical attention should symptoms worsen or if difficulty breathing develops.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day, to complete a 5-day course.  
- Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for fever or pain.

**Follow-up:**  
Follow-up in the Infectious Diseases clinic with Dr. Jane Smith on [April 19, 2023]. The patient was also advised on the importance of receiving the annual influenza vaccine in the future to reduce the risk of severe influenza.
