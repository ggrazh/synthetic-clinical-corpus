**Patient ID:** 452678JH  
**Name:** [Redacted for Privacy]  
**Date of Birth:** [Redacted for Privacy]  
**Admission Date:** September 14, 2023  
**Discharge Date:** September 21, 2023  
**Consulting Physician:** Dr. Elena Rodriguez, MD, Endocrinology  
**Primary Diagnosis:** Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
**Secondary Diagnoses:** Hypertension, Obesity  

**History and Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient, a 58-year-old male with a history of hypertension controlled with medication, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 14, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss over the past 2 months. The patient also reported a family history of type 2 diabetes.

**Clinical Findings:**  
Upon admission, vital signs were within normal limits except for elevated blood pressure (145/92 mmHg). Physical examination revealed a body mass index (BMI) of 33 kg/m2, indicating obesity. Initial laboratory tests showed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 210 mg/dL and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 8.5%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. The patient underwent a comprehensive evaluation, including foot and funduscopic examinations, which were normal, and urine testing for albuminuria, which was negative. Serum creatinine and lipid profile were within acceptable ranges but indicated room for improvement.

**Treatment and Management:**  
The patient was started on an individualized treatment plan, including dietary and lifestyle modifications. Metformin was initiated at a dosage of 500 mg twice daily, as it is the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes due to its efficacy, safety profile, and cost-effectiveness. Patient education sessions were conducted, covering the causes of diabetes, recognition of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia signs, and the importance of regular monitoring and medication adherence.

Due to the patient's obesity and the need for weight loss, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, was introduced at a dosage of 0.25 mg once weekly, titrated up to 2.4 mg over several weeks, to aid in weight management and blood glucose control.

**Dietary and Exercise Recommendations:**  
The patient received counseling from a dietitian to adopt a diet focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, tailored to accommodate his hypertension and obesity. Physical activity recommendations included at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic and resistance exercises, with precautions to adjust insulin or carbohydrate intake as necessary to avoid hypoglycemia.

**Follow-up and Monitoring:**  
The patient was advised to monitor his blood glucose levels at home and adjust his lifestyle and medication under the guidance of his healthcare team. Regular follow-up appointments were scheduled every 3 months to monitor HbA1C levels, with the goal of achieving an HbA1C below 7%, and to adjust treatment as necessary. Further screening for diabetic complications will be conducted annually, or more frequently if indicated.

**Vaccinations and Preventive Measures:**  
The patient was updated on vaccinations, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2, to reduce the risk of infections.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
The patient was discharged with instructions to adhere to the prescribed medication regimen, diet, and exercise plan. He was educated on the importance of foot care and was advised to seek regular podiatric care. Instructions were provided on how to adjust insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake. The patient was informed about the symptoms of potential diabetic complications and was advised to contact his healthcare provider if he experiences any such symptoms.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
The patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and has initiated treatment with metformin and semaglutide, along with significant lifestyle modifications. With adherence to the prescribed treatment plan and regular monitoring, the prognosis is optimistic for achieving good glycemic control and reducing the risk of diabetes-related complications.
