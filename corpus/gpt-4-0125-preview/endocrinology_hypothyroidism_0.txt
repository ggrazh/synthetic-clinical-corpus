**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** Jane Doe  
- **DOB:** 02/14/1980  
- **Hospital ID:** 987654321  
- **Admission Date:** 09/15/2023  
- **Discharge Date:** 09/25/2023  
- **Consulting Physician:** Dr. Elizabeth Ramirez, Endocrinology  
- **Diagnosis:** Primary Hypothyroidism

**History and Physical Examination:**  
Jane Doe, a 43-year-old female, presented to the emergency department on 09/15/2023 with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Physical examination revealed dry skin, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes. The patient reported these symptoms have been progressively worsening over the past 6 months. There was no significant past medical history or family history of thyroid disorders.

**Laboratory Findings and Diagnosis:**  
On 09/16/2023, blood tests were conducted revealing elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at 14 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and low serum free T4 levels at 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Additional tests showed mild normocytic-normochromic anemia and elevated serum cholesterol levels. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was confirmed.

**Treatment:**  
Levothyroxine therapy was initiated on 09/17/2023 at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, considering the patient's age and absence of heart disease. The patient was also advised on the importance of taking the medication on an empty stomach and not combining it with other medications that could interfere with its absorption.

**Hospital Course:**  
Jane's symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance began to improve by 09/20/2023. Follow-up laboratory tests on 09/22/2023 showed a decrease in TSH levels to 7 mIU/L, indicating a positive response to levothyroxine therapy, although still above the target range. The levothyroxine dose was adjusted to 125 mcg once daily. The patient was educated on the symptoms of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, emphasizing the importance of medication adherence and follow-up.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- **Medications:** Continue levothyroxine 125 mcg orally once daily. The patient was counseled on the importance of consistent medication timing and its interaction with food and other medications.
- **Follow-up:** Appointment with Dr. Elizabeth Ramirez in the Endocrinology clinic on 10/10/2023 for TSH and free T4 re-evaluation and dose adjustment as needed.
- **Diet and Lifestyle:** Advised a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Encouraged regular physical activity.
- **Symptom Monitoring:** Instructed to monitor for signs of hypothyroidism (e.g., fatigue, weight gain) and hyperthyroidism (e.g., palpitations, weight loss) and report any concerns to the physician immediately.

**Warnings and Precautions:**  
- **Emergency Situations:** Instructed to seek immediate medical attention for symptoms such as chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or palpitations.
- **Medication Adjustments:** Warned against self-adjusting medication without consulting the endocrinology team.
- **Pregnancy:** Informed of the need to notify the physician if pregnancy occurs, as levothyroxine dosing may need adjustment.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
Jane Doe was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism during her hospital stay from 09/15/2023 to 09/25/2023. With the initiation and adjustment of levothyroxine therapy, her symptoms have begun to improve. The prognosis is good with continued adherence to treatment and follow-up care. The patient demonstrated understanding of her condition and treatment plan at the time of discharge.
