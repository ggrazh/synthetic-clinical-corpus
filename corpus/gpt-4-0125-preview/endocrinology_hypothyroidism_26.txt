**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Name:** [John Doe]  
**MRN:** [XXXXXX]  
**Date of Birth:** [MM/DD/YYYY]  
**Admission Date:** [09/01/2023]  
**Discharge Date:** [09/15/2023]  
**Consulting Team:** Endocrinology  
**Primary Diagnosis:** Primary Hypothyroidism  
**Secondary Diagnoses:** Normocytic Normochromic Anemia, Hypercholesterolemia  

**Hospital Course:**

[John Doe], a [45-year-old] male with no significant past medical history, presented to the hospital on [09/01/2023] with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. Given these symptoms, primary hypothyroidism was suspected. Initial laboratory tests revealed elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels at [10 mIU/L] (normal: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and decreased free T4 levels at [0.8 ng/dL] (normal: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), confirming the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. The patient's triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Anemia workup showed normocytic normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of [10 g/dL]. Serum cholesterol was elevated at [240 mg/dL].

Management started with levothyroxine at a dose of [100 mcg] orally once a day, considering the patient's age and absence of known heart disease. The patient was closely monitored for any adverse reactions or need for dosage adjustments. Over the course of his hospital stay, the patient showed clinical improvement with reduced fatigue and gradual normalization of TSH and free T4 levels. The anemia was managed conservatively, expecting improvement with thyroid hormone replacement.

Given the risk of atherosclerosis associated with hypothyroidism-induced hypercholesterolemia, dietary counseling was provided, and statin therapy was considered but not initiated during the hospital stay, with a plan to reassess lipid levels in the outpatient setting.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Levothyroxine 100 mcg PO once daily in the morning on an empty stomach. The patient was counseled on the importance of consistent daily dosing and follow-up TSH level monitoring.

**Follow-up:**  
A follow-up appointment with endocrinology is scheduled for [10/15/2023] to reassess thyroid function tests and adjust levothyroxine dosage if necessary. The patient was educated on signs of both hypo- and hyperthyroidism and instructed to report any such symptoms. Additionally, follow-up for anemia and serum cholesterol reevaluation was arranged.

**Instructions for Patient:**  
- Take levothyroxine as prescribed, preferably in the morning on an empty stomach, and do not switch brands without consulting the healthcare provider.
- Adhere to the follow-up schedule for necessary blood tests and dosage adjustments.
- Maintain a balanced diet, and consider reducing intake of foods high in cholesterol.
- Be aware of symptoms indicative of thyroid hormone imbalance, including changes in weight, energy levels, heart rate, and temperature sensitivity.
- Contact the healthcare provider if experiencing chest pain, palpitations, extreme fatigue, or other concerning symptoms.

**Precautions:**  
- Alert healthcare providers about levothyroxine use before undergoing any new treatments or surgeries.
- Be cautious of potential interactions between levothyroxine and other medications, including supplements that might affect thyroid hormone levels or absorption.

**Emergency Contact:**  
In case of emergency, the patient is advised to visit the nearest emergency room or call [Emergency Contact Number].

This discharge summary outlines [John Doe's] diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up plan for primary hypothyroidism. It serves as a comprehensive guide for both the patient and his outpatient healthcare providers to ensure continuity of care.
