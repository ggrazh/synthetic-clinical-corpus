**Hospital Course:**  
The patient, a 45-year-old female, was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 15, 2023, with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and constipation. A detailed medical history revealed these symptoms had been progressively worsening over the past six months. Physical examination demonstrated dry skin, bradycardia, and delayed relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes. Given the clinical presentation, an initial suspicion of hypothyroidism was considered.

Laboratory tests were ordered, including a complete blood count (CBC), serum cholesterol, and thyroid function tests. CBC results were within normal limits, showing a slightly normocytic-normochromic anemia. Serum cholesterol was elevated at 245 mg/dL. The most telling were the thyroid function tests; serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) was significantly elevated at 14 mU/L (normal range 0.5-4.5 mU/L), and serum free Thyroxine (T4) was low at 0.4 ng/dL (normal range 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), confirming the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits.

Given the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism, treatment with Levothyroxine was initiated. Considering the patient's age and absence of known heart disease, a starting dose of 100 mcg orally once a day was prescribed. The patient was closely monitored for any adverse reactions or symptoms indicating a need for dosage adjustment. Over the course of the hospital stay, the patient reported a gradual improvement in symptoms.
