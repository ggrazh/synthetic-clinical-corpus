**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient ID:** 5678342  
**Name:** John Doe  
**Date of Birth:** MM/DD/YYYY  
**Admission Date:** 11/15/2023  
**Discharge Date:** 11/22/2023  
**Admitting Diagnosis:** Suspected Influenza  
**Final Diagnosis:** Influenza A  
**Consulting Services:** Infectious Diseases Unit  

**Hospital Course:**  
Mr. John Doe, a 45-year-old male with no significant past medical history, presented to the emergency department (ED) on 11/15/2023 with a 3-day history of high-grade fever, cough, sore throat, and body aches. Given the seasonal prevalence of influenza and his clinical presentation, influenza was highly suspected upon admission.

**Diagnostic Workup:**  
Initial investigations included a rapid antigen test for influenza, which returned positive for Influenza A. Considering the patient's hospitalization and to guide antiviral therapy, an RT-PCR test was also performed, confirming the diagnosis of Influenza A. Pulse oximetry indicated mild hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. A chest x-ray was conducted, revealing no evidence of pneumonia, only mild interstitial infiltrates consistent with viral infection. Blood tests, including a complete blood count (CBC), were within normal limits, indicating no secondary bacterial infection.

**Treatment:**  
Mr. Doe was admitted to the infectious diseases unit for management. Given the early stage of his symptoms, within 24 hours of onset, antiviral therapy was initiated. He was started on Oseltamivir, 75 mg orally twice a day for 5 days, to mitigate the severity and duration of his symptoms, as well as to decrease the potential for complications. Supportive care included hydration, rest, and acetaminophen for fever and body aches, strictly avoiding aspirin due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.

Throughout his hospital stay, Mr. Doe's symptoms gradually improved. His fever resolved by the third day of admission, and his oxygen saturation levels normalized without the need for supplemental oxygen. Repeat chest x-ray on day 5 showed clearing of the interstitial infiltrates. The patient reported significant improvement in cough and overall well-being by day 7 of his hospital stay.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
1. **Medications:** Continue taking Oseltamivir until the prescribed course is completed. Use acetaminophen as needed for fever or pain.
2. **Activity:** Gradual return to normal activities as tolerated. Avoid strenuous physical activities for at least 1-2 weeks.
3. **Diet:** Adequate hydration and a balanced diet to support recovery.
4. **Follow-Up:** Schedule a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician in 7-10 days or sooner if symptoms recur or worsen.
5. **Preventive Measures:** Practice good hand hygiene and avoid close contact with immunocompromised individuals until fully recovered. Consider receiving the influenza vaccine annually to prevent future infections.

**Summary and Plan:**  
Mr. John Doe was diagnosed with Influenza A and received antiviral therapy along with supportive care. He showed significant clinical improvement and was deemed stable for discharge with instructions for continued recovery at home. The patient and his family were educated on the nature of the illness, the importance of completing the antiviral course, and measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
