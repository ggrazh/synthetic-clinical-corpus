- **Hospital ID:** 123456789
- **Admission Date:** October 5, 2023
- **Discharge Date:** October 12, 2023
- **Attending Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton, Endocrinology Unit

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of extreme fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and dry skin over the past few months.

**History of Present Illness:**
Jane Doe, a 45-year-old female with no significant past medical history, presented to the Endocrinology unit on October 5, 2023, with several months of worsening symptoms including fatigue, unexplained weight gain, constipation, and cold intolerance. She noted her symptoms initially as mild but saw a progressive decline in her energy levels and physical well-being, prompting her hospital visit.

**Physical Examination:**
Upon physical examination, the patient appeared mildly edematous with dry skin. Vital signs on admission were stable with a blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate of 68 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and body temperature of 97.5°F (36.4°C). Thyroid palpation revealed no enlargement or nodules.

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- **Serum TSH:** Elevated at 10 IU/mL (Reference range: 0.5-4.5 IU/mL)
- **Free T4:** Low at 0.8 ng/dL (Reference range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL)
- **Serum T3:** Normal at 100 ng/dL (Reference range: 80-200 ng/dL)
- **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Indicated normocytic-normochromic anemia.
- **Serum Cholesterol:** Elevated at 245 mg/dL.

Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism.

**Hospital Course:**
Jane was immediately started on levothyroxine therapy upon diagnosis. Given her age and absence of heart disease, a starting dose of 100 mcg orally once a day was prescribed. The patient was monitored for adverse reactions to the medication, and her TSH and free T4 levels were re-evaluated on October 10, 2023, showing improvement with a TSH of 6 IU/mL and free T4 of 1.0 ng/dL. Her symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance showed marked improvement.

**Medications at Discharge:**
- **Levothyroxine 100 mcg** orally once a day. It was advised to take the medication on an empty stomach, at least 30 minutes before breakfast. The patient was educated on the importance of consistent daily dosing and follow-up blood tests to monitor thyroid function and adjust the dose if necessary.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
Jane Doe was advised to follow up with Dr. Emily Stanton in the Endocrinology outpatient clinic in 6 weeks for a repeat TSH and free T4 level to assess the need for dosage adjustment of levothyroxine. She was educated on the signs and symptoms of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism as part of her discharge education. Dietary recommendations were provided, emphasizing a balanced diet with adequate iodine intake.

**Specific Instructions:**
- Report any symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, or increased anxiety, which could indicate overtreatment.
- Maintain a consistent schedule for medication administration.
- Notify the clinic if she becomes pregnant, as levothyroxine dosage may need adjustment.

**Precautions:**
The patient was counseled on the importance of not switching brands of levothyroxine without consulting her healthcare provider due to potential variations in bioavailability.

**Discharge Condition:**
The patient was discharged in a stable condition with significant improvement in her initial symptoms. She verbalized understanding of her discharge instructions and the importance of follow-up appointments.
