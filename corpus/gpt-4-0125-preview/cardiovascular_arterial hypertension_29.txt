Date of Discharge: September 20, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Jane Smith, MD, Cardiology  
Hospital: Memorial Cardiovascular Center  

**Reason for Admission:**  
John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit with concerns of persistent headaches, episodes of dizziness, and a recorded home blood pressure consistently above 140/90 mm Hg. The patient has a medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia. There was a suspicion of uncontrolled arterial hypertension.

**Medical History:**  
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
- Hyperlipidemia  
- Family history of cardiovascular disease  

**Medications Prior to Admission:**  
- Metformin 500 mg twice daily  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg once daily  

**Hospital Course and Management:**  
Upon admission, John Doe underwent a comprehensive evaluation including history taking, physical examination, and diagnostic testing. Blood pressure measurements were taken in both arms, with the right arm showing consistently higher readings; the highest recorded was 158/102 mm Hg. The physical examination showed no signs of target organ damage. Diagnostic tests included urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and an ECG, which showed no abnormalities. Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within normal ranges. Given the patient's history and diagnostic findings, a diagnosis of primary arterial hypertension was made.

**Treatment Initiation:**  
The patient was started on a regimen of Lisinopril, a dose of 10 mg once daily, and a Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) 25 mg once daily, considering his history of diabetes. Lifestyle modifications were strongly emphasized, including dietary changes, increased physical activity, and sodium intake reduction to less than 1500 mg/day. The patient was educated on the importance of medication adherence, lifestyle changes, and regular blood pressure monitoring at home.

**Follow-Up and Adjustments:**  
John Doe's blood pressure showed improvement during the hospital stay, with readings gradually reducing to an average of 134/86 mm Hg. However, due to a slight increase in serum potassium levels, the Lisinopril dose was adjusted to 5 mg once daily after 5 days. The patient tolerated the medications well without any significant side effects.

**Discharge Plan:**  
- Continue Lisinopril 5 mg once daily.  
- Continue Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg once daily.  
- Follow-up appointment in 2 weeks with Dr. Jane Smith, MD, for blood pressure reassessment and medication adjustment as needed.  
- Daily blood pressure monitoring at home with a calibrated sphygmomanometer.  
- Lifestyle modifications to continue as advised, with a focus on dietary changes, weight loss, and increased physical activity.  
- Patient education was reinforced regarding the chronic nature of hypertension and the importance of adherence to the treatment plan.  

**Patient Education:**  
John Doe was provided with detailed education on arterial hypertension, including the need for long-term management, potential complications if uncontrolled, and the importance of lifestyle modifications alongside medication. He was taught how to accurately measure his blood pressure at home and instructed to keep a log of his readings. Dietary advice was given, focusing on reducing sodium intake and adopting a heart-healthy diet.

**Conclusion:**  
The patient demonstrated a good understanding of his diagnosis, the importance of lifestyle modifications, and the necessity of medication adherence. He is being discharged in a stable condition with a follow-up appointment scheduled. The patient and family expressed their understanding of the discharge instructions and the importance of the follow-up for the ongoing management of his arterial hypertension.
