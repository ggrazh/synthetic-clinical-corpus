**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**

- Name: Jane Doe
- Age: 47
- Gender: Female
- Admission Date: September 15, 2023
- Discharge Date: September 22, 2023
- Attending Physician: Dr. Sarah Lin, MD, Endocrinology

**Admission Diagnosis:**

The patient was admitted to the endocrinology unit with symptoms indicative of hypothyroidism, including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and dry skin. The patient reported these symptoms have progressively worsened over the past 6 months.

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**

Upon admission, a comprehensive laboratory workup was initiated, focusing on thyroid function tests. The results revealed a Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level of 10.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.0 mIU/L) and a Serum Free T4 level of 0.7 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL), confirming the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. Serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels were within normal limits. Additional tests showed normocytic-normochromic anemia and elevated serum cholesterol levels. 

Given the patient's age and absence of known heart disease, treatment with Levothyroxine was initiated at a dose of 100 mcg orally once a day. The patient was closely monitored for adverse reactions, and no significant side effects were noted. 

The patient received education on hypothyroidism, including the importance of medication adherence, potential side effects, and the need for regular follow-up blood tests to monitor thyroid function. The patient was also counseled on the potential need for dosage adjustments based on TSH levels and clinical symptoms.

**Discharge Medications:**

- Levothyroxine 100 mcg orally once a day. The patient has been advised that the dose may need adjustment based on follow-up TSH levels. The next TSH measurement is scheduled for 6 weeks post-discharge.

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**

- The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. Sarah Lin in 6 weeks to review thyroid function tests and adjust the Levothyroxine dose if necessary.
- The patient has been advised to monitor for symptoms of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism, including palpitations, increased anxiety, weight loss, or return of previous symptoms, and to seek medical attention if these occur.
- The patient has been educated on the importance of taking Levothyroxine on an empty stomach and avoiding certain medications and supplements within 4 hours of taking Levothyroxine.
- The patient has been informed of the potential need for increased Levothyroxine dosage in certain situations such as pregnancy or when starting medications that affect T4 absorption.

**Condition at Discharge:**

The patient's condition has improved with the initiation of Levothyroxine therapy. Symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance have begun to diminish. The patient is stable and has been discharged in a good condition with instructions for outpatient follow-up and medication management.
