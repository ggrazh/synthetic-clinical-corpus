**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Age:** 58 years  
- **Sex:** Male  
- **MRN:** 0011223344  
- **Date of Admission:** September 20, 2023  
- **Date of Discharge:** September 26, 2023  
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Jane Smith, MD, Cardiovascular Medicine  

**Reason for Admission:**  
John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on September 20, 2023, with complaints of persistent headaches, episodes of dizziness, and a recent history of elevated blood pressure readings taken at home. Given his symptoms and medical history, an evaluation for arterial hypertension was initiated.

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon admission, initial blood pressure readings were taken in both arms, revealing a higher reading in the left arm (160/100 mm Hg). This arm was used for subsequent measurements. A comprehensive history and physical examination were conducted, noting Mr. Doe's weight of 230 pounds and a waist circumference indicating obesity. Diagnostic testing included a urinalysis, lipid panel, comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, and an ECG, all of which were within normal limits except for elevated LDL cholesterol and fasting plasma glucose levels.

Mr. Doe's blood pressure was monitored using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over 24 hours, confirming the diagnosis of arterial hypertension with average readings of 150/95 mm Hg. No evidence of 'white coat hypertension' was observed. The patient was evaluated for secondary causes of hypertension, including primary aldosteronism, but results did not indicate any endocrine abnormalities.

**Treatment:**  
Initial treatment focused on lifestyle modifications, including a dietary plan aiming for a sodium intake of less than 1500 mg/day, increased physical activity, and a structured weight loss program. Mr. Doe was counseled extensively on the importance of these changes.

Pharmacological treatment was initiated with Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, at a dose of 10 mg once daily, considering the absence of contraindications to ACE inhibitors in Mr. Doe's case. His response to the medication was monitored closely, with adjustments made based on blood pressure readings taken during his stay. Due to persistent elevated blood pressure readings, Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, was added at a dose of 5 mg once daily on September 23, 2023.

**Outcome:**  
Mr. Doe's blood pressure showed a gradual improvement over his hospital stay, with readings approaching the target of < 130/80 mm Hg towards the time of discharge. He tolerated the medications well, with no significant adverse effects reported.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Lisinopril 10 mg orally, once daily.
- Amlodipine 5 mg orally, once daily.

**Follow-Up:**  
Mr. Doe has been scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the outpatient cardiovascular clinic on October 10, 2023, with Dr. Jane Smith. He has been instructed to monitor his blood pressure at home twice daily and record the readings. He is also encouraged to continue with the lifestyle modifications initiated during his stay. Adjustments to his medication regimen will be considered based on his blood pressure control and tolerance to the current medications.

**Patient Education:**  
Mr. Doe received comprehensive education on the chronic nature of hypertension, the importance of adherence to therapy, lifestyle modifications, and the potential complications of uncontrolled blood pressure. He was taught how to properly measure his blood pressure at home and instructed to report any symptoms of potential complications immediately.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue with prescribed medications without interruption.
- Follow the dietary and lifestyle recommendations provided.
- Monitor blood pressure at home as instructed and keep a log of the readings.
- Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments.
- Contact the cardiovascular unit or primary care physician if experiencing any concerning symptoms or side effects related to medication.
