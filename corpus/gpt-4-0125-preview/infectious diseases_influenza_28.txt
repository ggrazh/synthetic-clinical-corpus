**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** [Patient Name]  
- **DOB:** [Date of Birth]  
- **MRN:** [Medical Record Number]  
- **Admission Date:** September 20, 2023  
- **Discharge Date:** September 27, 2023  
- **Consulting Physician:** Dr. [Physician Name]  
- **Diagnosis:** Influenza  

**Hospital Course and Management:**  
The patient, a [age]-year-old [male/female], presented to the infectious diseases unit on September 20, 2023, with symptoms including high fever, cough, sore throat, and body aches. The initial clinical impression was suggestive of influenza, particularly given the ongoing influenza outbreak in the community.

**Diagnostic Tests and Results:**  
Upon admission, a rapid antigen test was performed, which yielded a positive result for influenza A. To confirm the diagnosis and to guide antiviral therapy, an RT-PCR test was conducted, which also confirmed influenza A infection. Given the patient's severe respiratory symptoms, pulse oximetry was performed, showing mild hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. A chest x-ray was obtained, revealing interstitial infiltrates consistent with primary influenza pneumonia. No signs of secondary bacterial pneumonia were observed.

**Treatment:**  
The patient was started on antiviral therapy within 24 hours of symptom onset. Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day was prescribed for a course of 5 days. The patient was also advised on the importance of rest, hydration, and the use of antipyretics for fever management. Aspirin was avoided due to the risk of Reye's syndrome, and acetaminophen was recommended instead for fever and pain control. Supportive care measures, including supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula, were initiated to maintain oxygen saturation above 94%.

**Response to Treatment:**  
The patient showed significant improvement over the course of the hospital stay. Fever resolved by the third day of antiviral treatment, and respiratory symptoms gradually improved. By the time of discharge, the patient was afebrile, had markedly reduced cough, and reported no significant shortness of breath. Oxygen therapy was discontinued on September 25, 2023, as the patient maintained satisfactory oxygen levels on room air.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue to rest and ensure adequate fluid intake.
- Complete the prescribed course of Oseltamivir.
- Use acetaminophen as needed for fever or pain.
- Avoid contact with other individuals until 24 hours after fever resolution without the use of fever-reducing medications to prevent the spread of infection.
- Follow up with the primary care provider or the infectious diseases clinic in 1 week or sooner if symptoms recur or worsen.

**Follow-up:**  
A follow-up appointment is scheduled for October 4, 2023, with Dr. [Physician Name] in the infectious diseases clinic to ensure full recovery and to address any ongoing concerns.

**Medications at Discharge:**
- Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for 2 more days.
- Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed for fever or pain.

**Preventative Measures:**  
The patient was counseled on the importance of annual influenza vaccination and good hand hygiene practices to prevent future infections.

**Summary:**  
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of influenza confirmed by rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests and was managed successfully with antiviral therapy, supportive care, and symptom management. The patient has been advised on follow-up care and preventative measures.
