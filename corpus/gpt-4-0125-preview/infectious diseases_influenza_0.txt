The patient reported no significant past medical history or recent travel but noted that influenza was currently widespread in the community.

Upon admission, a rapid antigen test was performed, which returned positive for Influenza A. To confirm the diagnosis and inform treatment decisions, an RT-PCR test was also conducted and confirmed the presence of Influenza A H3N2 subtype. Chest X-ray and pulse oximetry were performed due to the severity of respiratory symptoms, revealing mild interstitial infiltrates without evidence of bacterial pneumonia, and oxygen saturation was 94% on room air.

**Treatment Summary:**  
Given the patient's severe symptoms and the confirmation of influenza infection, antiviral treatment was initiated within hours of hospital admission. The patient was started on Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day for a 5-day course, starting on July 5, 2023. Symptomatic treatment for fever and myalgias included acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours as needed. Aspirin was avoided due to the patient's age. The patient was advised to maintain adequate hydration and was placed on bed rest for the initial days of the hospital stay.

Throughout the hospital stay, the patient was monitored for signs of complications, including secondary bacterial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but thankfully, these did not develop.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- The patient is to complete the prescribed course of Oseltamivir, with the last dose to be taken on the evening of July 15, 2023.
