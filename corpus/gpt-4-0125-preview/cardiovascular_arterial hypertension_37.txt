**History of Present Illness:**  
John Doe, a 53-year-old male with a past medical history significant for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, presented to the emergency department on 09/15/2023 with severe headaches and dizziness. The patient reported that these symptoms had been progressively worsening over the past month. He also noted occasional blurred vision. He denied any chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea.

- Physical findings: No signs of hypertensive retinopathy were observed upon fundoscopic examination. There was no evidence of peripheral edema. Cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  

**Diagnostic Workup:**  
- **Laboratory Tests:** Comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were within normal limits except for elevated fasting plasma glucose indicative of poorly controlled diabetes.  
- **Urinalysis:** Normal  
- **ECG:** Normal sinus rhythm with no signs of left ventricular hypertrophy  
- **Blood Pressure Monitoring:** The patient underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, which confirmed the diagnosis of arterial hypertension with an average reading of 155/95 mmHg.

**Hospital Course:**  
John Doe was diagnosed with arterial hypertension and started on initial medication treatment. Given his history of diabetes mellitus, an ACE inhibitor, Lisinopril 20 mg once daily, was initiated for blood pressure management. Lifestyle modifications were strongly emphasized, including a dietary plan aiming for a reduced sodium intake below 1500 mg/day, increased physical activity, and weight loss. The patient was educated about the chronic nature of hypertension, the importance of medication adherence, and lifestyle modification for managing his condition. He was also taught how to monitor his blood pressure at home.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Lisinopril 20 mg orally, once daily  
- Metformin 500 mg orally, twice daily (for diabetes)  
- A statin was considered for lipid management, but given the patient's normal lipid panel, it was decided to focus on lifestyle modifications first.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
- The patient is scheduled for a follow-up visit with Dr. Jane Smith in two weeks on 10/09/2023 to reassess blood pressure control and Lisinopril efficacy.  
- The patient is advised to monitor his blood pressure at home twice daily and keep a log.  
- Continue with the prescribed diet and increase physical activity, aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.  
- The patient is encouraged to lose weight, targeting a 5-10% reduction in body weight over the next 6 months.  
- Smoking cessation was discussed. The patient, a non-smoker, was commended for avoiding tobacco products.  

**Discharge Condition:**  
The patient was stable at the time of discharge, with improved blood pressure readings averaging 140/85 mmHg during his hospital stay post-medication initiation. He understood his discharge instructions and expressed commitment to adhering to the prescribed treatment and follow-up plan.
