**History and Physical Examination:**  
Mr. John Doe was admitted to the hospital on September 15, 2023, with complaints of persistent thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, and blurred vision over the past two months. Physical examination revealed a BMI of 32 kg/m^2, blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, and a regular heart rate of 78 bpm. No specific abnormalities were noted on cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurological examinations. Initial laboratory investigations showed fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels of 220 mg/dL and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 9.0%, indicating uncontrolled hyperglycemia and confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Hospital Course:**  
Mr. Doe was initially managed with an intravenous insulin infusion to stabilize his blood glucose levels. Education on diabetes management, including diet, exercise, and the importance of medication adherence, was provided by our diabetes education team. After achieving stabilization, Mr. Doe was transitioned to a subcutaneous insulin regimen. On September 18, his HbA1C levels were re-evaluated, showing a slight improvement to 8.5%. Considering his chronic condition and the need for long-term management, oral medications were introduced. Metformin 500 mg twice daily was started as the first-line treatment. Additionally, considering Mr. Doeâ€™s obesity and the need for weight management, semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly was added to his regimen. His blood glucose levels were monitored closely, showing gradual improvement over the week. Dietary consultations were provided, focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, and a physical exercise plan was established, recommending at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
1. Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily  
2. Semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once a week  
3. Insulin Glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime (as needed, based on self-monitoring blood glucose results)  

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
Mr. Doe has been scheduled for a follow-up visit in the outpatient endocrinology clinic on October 10, 2023, with Dr. Emily Stanton. It is crucial that Mr. Doe adheres to his prescribed medication plan, dietary recommendations, and physical activity guidelines. Blood glucose self-monitoring should be performed at least four times a day, and the results should be recorded for review during the follow-up appointment. Mr. Doe has been educated on the symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and instructed on the necessary steps to take in case these occur. Additionally, he has been advised to seek podiatric care and keep up to date with recommended vaccinations, including influenza and pneumococcal vaccines.

**Complications Screening:**  
Screening for diabetic complications was initiated, including a comprehensive foot examination, funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist, and baseline laboratory tests for albuminuria, serum creatinine, and lipid profile. No complications were identified at the time of discharge. However, Mr. Doe has been advised of the importance of regular screening to prevent or detect early signs of complications.

**Patient Education:**  
Extensive education was provided on the management of type 2 diabetes, including dietary management, the importance of physical activity, and medication adherence. Mr. Doe was also educated on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake. This education will be reinforced during each physician visit and is crucial for the effective management of his condition.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
Mr. Doe has been instructed to immediately report any signs of persistent hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, or any new symptoms that may arise. He has been provided with written materials on diet, exercise, and medication management, along with emergency contact numbers for the endocrinology department.

**Summary and Plan:**  
Mr. John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and has been stabilized with a combination of insulin, metformin, and semaglutide. He has been educated extensively on disease management and lifestyle modifications. Close follow-up in the outpatient setting is essential for monitoring his condition and adjusting his treatment plan as needed.
