Admission Date: September 15, 2023  
Discharge Date: September 22, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. [Physician's Name], Endocrinology Unit  
Primary Diagnosis: Primary Hypothyroidism  

**History and Presenting Complaint:**  
The patient, a [age]-year-old [gender] with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, presented to the Endocrinology Unit on September 15, 2023, with complaints of fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance persisting for the last six months. The patient also reported experiencing constipation and dry skin. There was no prior diagnosis of thyroid disease, and the patient had not been on any thyroid medications.

**Investigations:**  
Upon admission, the following tests were performed:  
- Serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) measurement: Elevated at 10.5 mIU/L (normal range: 0.5-4.5 mIU/L)  
- Serum Free T4: Low at 0.8 ng/dL (normal range: 0.9-1.7 ng/dL)  
- Complete Blood Count (CBC): Indicated normocytic-normochromic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL  
- Serum Cholesterol: Elevated at 240 mg/dL  
- Serum triiodothyronine (T3): Within normal limits  

Based on these findings, a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism was made.

**Treatment:**  
The patient was started on Levothyroxine, with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day, considering the patient's age and absence of heart disease. The dose was selected to gradually correct the hypothyroid state without precipitating any adverse effects.

**Response to Treatment:**  
The patient demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms over a week. Fatigue and cold intolerance were markedly reduced. A follow-up TSH level on September 21, 2023, showed a decrease to 6.5 mIU/L, indicating an improvement but suggesting the need for a slight adjustment in Levothyroxine dosage.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- Levothyroxine 112 mcg orally once a day. The dosage was adjusted based on the latest TSH levels.  
- Continue with previous medications for hypertension and hyperlipidemia as prescribed before admission.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
- The patient is advised to follow up in the endocrinology clinic in 6 weeks for reevaluation of thyroid function tests and further adjustment of Levothyroxine dosage as needed.  
- Monitor symptoms of hypothyroidism and report any exacerbations.  
- A diet low in cholesterol and saturated fats is recommended, considering the elevated serum cholesterol levels.  
- Regular exercise is encouraged as part of weight management and overall well-being.

**Precautions:**  
- The patient has been counseled on the importance of taking Levothyroxine on an empty stomach and not within an hour of eating to ensure proper absorption.  
- The patient has been informed about the signs of both under-treatment and over-treatment with Levothyroxine, including palpitations, excessive sweating, and anxiety, and to seek medical attention if these occur.

**Discharge Condition:**  
The patient was discharged in a stable condition with significant improvement in initial symptoms. The patient and family were educated about the chronic nature of hypothyroidism and the importance of adherence to medication and follow-up appointments.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Take Levothyroxine 112 mcg orally once daily in the morning on an empty stomach.  
- Follow up in the endocrinology clinic as scheduled.  
- Monitor and report any new or worsening symptoms.
