**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
Name: John Doe  
Age: 29  
Gender: Male  
Date of Admission: September 15, 2023  
Date of Discharge: September 25, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Sarah Lin, MD, Endocrinology  
Primary Diagnosis: Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus  

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**  
John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 15, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and significant unintentional weight loss over the past two months. Given the clinical presentation, a series of diagnostic tests were conducted, including Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG), Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C), and an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT).

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- FPG: 280 mg/dL
- HbA1C: 12.3%
- OGTT: 320 mg/dL at 2 hours

The results confirmed the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. John was immediately started on insulin therapy to manage his blood glucose levels. 

**Medication Regimen:**
1. Insulin Glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime for basal coverage.
2. Insulin Lispro initiated at a dosing regimen of 0.5 units/kg/day, divided into doses administered before meals to manage prandial blood glucose excursions.

Throughout his hospital stay, blood glucose monitoring was conducted four times daily (pre-meal and at bedtime) to adjust insulin doses accordingly. A registered dietitian provided education on carbohydrate counting and meal planning to match insulin therapy. 

**Complications Screening:**
Given the new diagnosis, screening for diabetic complications was initiated:
- A comprehensive foot examination revealed no signs of peripheral neuropathy.
- Funduscopic examination by an ophthalmologist showed no signs of retinopathy.
- A spot urine test for albuminuria and serum creatinine measurement were within normal limits, indicating no current kidney involvement.

**Education:**
John received comprehensive diabetes education, covering the following essential topics:
- Nature and management of Type 1 Diabetes
- Recognition and management of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia
- Importance of routine monitoring of blood glucose
- Dietary recommendations focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates
- The significance of regular physical activity and its impact on blood glucose management
- The need for regular follow-up visits for ongoing diabetes management and screening for complications

**Vaccinations Administered:**
- Influenza vaccine
- Pneumococcal vaccine
- Hepatitis B vaccine series initiated

**Follow-Up Care:**
John has been scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic on October 10, 2023, with Dr. Sarah Lin. At this visit, his insulin regimen will be reviewed and adjusted as necessary based on his blood glucose logs. Additionally, further education on diabetes management will be provided, and screening for diabetic complications will continue as recommended.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue with the prescribed insulin regimen and blood glucose monitoring as instructed.
- Follow the dietary and exercise recommendations provided by the dietitian and diabetes educator.
- Be vigilant for signs of hypoglycemia and have a plan for its management.
- Schedule and attend all follow-up appointments, including with the ophthalmologist and podiatrist, as recommended.

**Physician's Notes:**
John has demonstrated an understanding of his diagnosis and the necessary steps for management. He is encouraged to maintain open communication with his healthcare team and reach out with any questions or concerns regarding his diabetes management.
