**Chief Complaint:**
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of persistent thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, and general fatigue over the past two months.

**Medical History:**
Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension controlled with medication and a family history of type 2 diabetes (mother and paternal uncle). No known drug allergies. Non-smoker and moderate alcohol use.

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**
- **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)**: On admission, the patient's FPG level was 220 mg/dL.
- **Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C)**: Initial testing showed an HbA1C of 9.2%.
- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)**: Not performed due to clear diagnostic indicators from FPG and HbA1C.
- **Random Glucose Test**: Conducted upon admission showed a glucose level of 210 mg/dL.
- Additional screenings for diabetic complications were initiated, including a foot examination (no ulcers or sensory loss noted), funduscopic examination (mild non-proliferative retinopathy detected), urine testing for albuminuria (normal), serum creatinine (within normal limits), and lipid profile (LDL cholesterol was elevated).

**Diagnosis:**
Based on the diagnostic criteria, Mr. Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Treatment and Management:**
- **Medications Initiated:**
  - Metformin 500 mg twice daily, with plans to increase the dosage as tolerated to improve glycemic control.
  - Simvastatin 20 mg once daily at bedtime for LDL cholesterol management.
- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and SGLT2 Inhibitors**: Discussed as future therapeutic options depending on the patient's response to initial therapy and his kidney function monitoring.
- **Patient Education**: Comprehensive education was provided covering the causes of diabetes, recognizing symptoms and signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and understanding diabetic complications. Mr. Doe was educated on dietary recommendations focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, the importance of physical activity including at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic and resistance exercises, and the need for regular monitoring of blood glucose levels.
- **Physical Activity**: Advised on safe practices to adjust insulin or carbohydrate intake before exercise to avoid hypoglycemia.
- **Vaccinations**: Updated influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccinations. Advised on obtaining SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
- **Referrals**: Referred to a dietician for personalized dietary planning, a podiatrist for regular foot care, and an ophthalmologist for annual eye examinations.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
- A follow-up appointment with the endocrinology unit is scheduled for six weeks post-discharge to re-evaluate Mr. Doe's response to the treatment, adjust medication dosages as necessary, and discuss the introduction of GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors if indicated.
- Recommended continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to better understand glucose patterns and variability for more tailored insulin therapy adjustments in the future.
- Emphasized the importance of adhering to the prescribed treatment plan, including medication, diet, exercise, and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Mr. Doe was discharged with a detailed medication schedule, including the importance of taking metformin with meals to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
- Provided with detailed educational materials on managing type 2 diabetes, including recognizing signs of complications.
- Instructed to monitor his blood glucose levels at least four times a day and keep a log to be reviewed during follow-up visits.
- Advised to immediately report any symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

The patient expressed understanding of his diagnosis, treatment plan, and the importance of follow-up care. He was discharged in stable condition with all necessary prescriptions and referrals.
