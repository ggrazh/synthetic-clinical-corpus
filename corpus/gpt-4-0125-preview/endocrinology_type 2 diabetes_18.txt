**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
Name: John Doe  
Age: 54 years  
Sex: Male  
Date of Admission: October 5, 2023  
Date of Discharge: October 12, 2023  
Admitting Physician: Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology  
Primary Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

**History and Presenting Complaints:**  
Mr. John Doe presented to the hospital on October 5, 2023, with complaints of persistent thirst, frequent urination, and unexplained weight loss over the past two months. He also reported episodes of blurred vision and fatigue. There was no significant past medical history except for hypertension. Family history revealed that his mother had type 2 diabetes.

**Clinical Findings:**  
Physical examination upon admission revealed a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/m^2, blood pressure of 142/88 mmHg, and no signs of diabetic foot ulceration. Initial laboratory tests showed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 210 mg/dL and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 9.2%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. A urine test for albuminuria and a serum creatinine test were performed to screen for early nephropathy; results were within normal limits. A comprehensive lipid profile was also ordered, showing elevated LDL cholesterol levels.

**Hospital Course:**  
Mr. Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit for diabetes management and education. He was initiated on Metformin 500 mg twice daily, after meals, as the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes. Given his high HbA1C level, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, was added at a dose of 0.25 mg once weekly, with plans to titrate based on tolerance and glycemic control. Diet and lifestyle modifications were strongly emphasized, including individualized dietary counseling focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. Mr. Doe was enrolled in a diabetes education program covering disease management, symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and the importance of regular monitoring and medication adherence.

Throughout his hospital stay, Mr. Doe's glucose levels were closely monitored, showing gradual improvement. He tolerated the medications without any adverse effects. A tailored physical activity program was developed, recommending at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise weekly, along with resistance training. Adjustments for hypoglycemia risk during exercise were discussed in detail.

**Discharge Medications:**  
1. Metformin 500 mg orally, twice daily after meals.  
2. Semaglutide 0.25 mg subcutaneously, once weekly; to increase to 0.5 mg after 4 weeks.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the endocrinology clinic on November 10, 2023, with Dr. Stanton. At this visit, his response to the treatment regimen will be assessed, including potential titration of semaglutide and reevaluation of his Metformin dose. His HbA1C target is <7%, as per ADA guidelines. He is advised to continue with the prescribed diet and exercise program and monitor his blood glucose levels at home, recording fasting and postprandial readings for discussion during his follow-up.

**Education:**  
Extensive patient education was provided focusing on the causes of diabetes, signs and symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia, dietary management, the importance of physical activity, and foot care. Mr. Doe was educated on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake, though he is not on insulin therapy at this stage.

**Vaccinations:**  
Mr. Doe was updated on his vaccinations, including influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B, as recommended for patients with diabetes. He had previously received the COVID-19 vaccine.

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
Mr. John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings. With the initiation of Metformin and semaglutide, along with significant lifestyle modifications, his glucose control has begun to improve. Continued adherence to the treatment plan and lifestyle changes is crucial for the management of his diabetes and the prevention of complications. The prognosis is good with appropriate management.
