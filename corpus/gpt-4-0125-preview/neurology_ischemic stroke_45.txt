**Chief Complaint**: Sudden onset of right-sided weakness and slurred speech.  

**History of Present Illness**: The patient was brought to the emergency department on July 15, 2023, at approximately 10:00 AM, after his wife noticed him slurring his speech and experiencing right arm and leg weakness. The onset of symptoms was around 9:30 AM on the same day.

**Past Medical History**: Hypertension, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Hyperlipidemia.

**Physical Examination upon Admission**:  
- Blood Pressure: 165/95 mmHg  
- Heart Rate: 88 bpm  
- NIHSS Score: 12, indicating moderate stroke  
- Right arm and leg weakness, facial droop, and slurred speech were noted.  
- No bleeding issues were identified.

**Diagnostic Tests**:  
- **CT Brain** (July 15, 2023): No hemorrhage, signs consistent with acute left middle cerebral artery (MCA) ischemic stroke.  
- **MRI Brain with Diffusion Weighting** (July 15, 2023): Confirmed acute ischemic stroke in the left MCA territory.  
- **ECG and Cardiac Monitoring**: Normal sinus rhythm, no acute changes.  
- **Echocardiography**: Normal left ventricular function, no cardiac source of embolus identified.  
- **Vascular Imaging**: MRA revealed significant stenosis in the left internal carotid artery.  
- **Blood Tests**: CBC, metabolic panel, PT/PTT, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1C, and lipid profile within abnormal limits indicating controlled diabetes and hyperlipidemia.

**Treatment Summary**:  
- **Acute Management**:  
  - **IV tPA** administered on July 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM. Dosage was 0.9 mg/kg (total dose: 81 mg), with 8.1 mg given as a rapid IV injection and the remainder over 60 minutes.  
  - Blood pressure was managed with IV antihypertensives to maintain systolic BP < 180 mmHg for 24 hours post-tPA administration.  
  - **Mechanical Thrombectomy** was not performed due to patient improvement post-tPA and absence of large vessel occlusion amenable to retrieval.

- **Secondary Prevention and Rehabilitation**:  
  - Aspirin 325 mg daily started on July 17, 2023.  
  - Clopidogrel 75 mg daily initiated on July 17, 2023, for dual antiplatelet therapy for 21 days.  
  - Lipid management with Atorvastatin 40 mg daily.  
  - Antihypertensive regimen adjusted to achieve target BP < 130/80 mmHg.  
  - Intensive rehabilitation program commenced on July 18, 2023, focusing on physical, occupational, and speech therapy.  
  - Diabetes management continued with Metformin 1000 mg twice a day, and lifestyle modifications were emphasized.

**Follow-up and Recommendations**:  
- The patient showed significant improvement in muscle strength and speech. NIHSS score upon discharge was 4.  
- **Follow-up Appointments**:  
  - Neurology follow-up in 2 weeks for assessment of recovery and potential medication adjustments.  
  - Cardiology consult recommended for further assessment of carotid stenosis and consideration of intervention.  
- **Medications upon Discharge**:  
  - Aspirin 81 mg daily (after 21 days of dual antiplatelet therapy).  
  - Clopidogrel 75 mg daily for a total of 21 days.  
  - Atorvastatin 40 mg at bedtime.  
  - Antihypertensive medications as per outpatient regimen.  
  - Continue diabetes management with existing dose of Metformin.  

**Lifestyle and Risk Factor Management**:  
- Advised smoking cessation, moderate physical activity as tolerated, and dietary modifications to reduce stroke risk factors.  

**Discharge Instructions**:  
- The patient and family were educated on stroke signs and symptoms, the importance of adherence to medications, and lifestyle modifications to prevent stroke recurrence.  
- Instructed to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms of stroke recur.
