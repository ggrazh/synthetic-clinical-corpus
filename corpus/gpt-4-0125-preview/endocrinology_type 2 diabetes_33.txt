**Diagnosis:**  
Based on the investigation results and clinical presentation, Mr. Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Treatment and Management:**  
- **Medications Initiated:**  
  - **Metformin:** Started at 500 mg twice daily with meals, increased to 1000 mg twice daily after 1 week due to tolerability and to improve glycemic control.  
  - **Semaglutide:** Initiated at 0.25 mg once weekly, titrated up to 0.5 mg after 1 week, with plans to further adjust based on glycemic response and tolerability.  
  - **Lisinopril 20 mg once daily** for hypertension, continued from prior regimen.  
  - **Atorvastatin 20 mg once daily** for dyslipidemia.  

- **Lifestyle Modifications:**  
  - Dietary counseling provided focusing on whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and balanced meals to manage weight and improve glycemic control.  
  - Recommended at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity per week, along with resistance training exercises twice a week.  
  - Patient education on self-monitoring of blood glucose, recognizing signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and the importance of regular podiatric care.

- **Patient Education:**  
  - Comprehensive diabetes education was provided, covering the nature of the disease, management strategies, and the importance of adherence to treatment and lifestyle modifications.  
  - Educated about adjusting insulin doses (in the future if required) based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake.  
  - Instructed on the importance of vaccinations, including influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
- **Follow-up Appointment:** Scheduled with Dr. Jane Smith on 10/15/2023 for medication review and adjustment if necessary.  
- **Ophthalmology:** Referral for annual retinal examinations.  
- **Podiatry:** Referral for regular foot care due to decreased sensation and risk of diabetic foot.

- Metformin 1000 mg twice daily  
- Semaglutide 0.5 mg once weekly

**Summary and Prognosis:**  
Mr. Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus during his admission. With the initiation of metformin, semaglutide, and lifestyle modifications, his blood glucose levels have started to improve. Early detection of mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy necessitates regular ophthalmologic follow-up. His prognosis is good with adherence to prescribed medications, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring and follow-up care.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Adhere to the medication regimen and monitor for any side effects.  
- Implement lifestyle modifications as advised.
