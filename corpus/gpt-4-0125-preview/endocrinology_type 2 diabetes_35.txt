**Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 12, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unintentional weight loss over the past three months. Initial laboratory tests revealed a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level of 210 mg/dL and a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) of 9.2%, confirming the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) conducted on September 13, 2023, further substantiated the diagnosis. Given the patient's significant hyperglycemia, immediate management started with lifestyle modification advice, focusing on diet and exercise, and pharmacotherapy.

**Treatment Initiated:**

- Education on diet and physical activity was provided, emphasizing the importance of at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity and resistance training.
- The patient was educated on the symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, and the importance of regular monitoring of blood glucose levels.

**Complication Screening:**
- Comprehensive foot and funduscopic examinations were performed, revealing no immediate signs of diabetic complications.
- Urine testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine levels were within normal limits, indicating no sign of diabetic nephropathy at discharge.
- A lipid profile was obtained, showing elevated LDL cholesterol, for which the patient was advised on dietary modifications and initiated on statin therapy.

**Patient Education:**
The patient underwent detailed education sessions on managing type 2 diabetes, including:
- Understanding the causes of diabetes and the importance of blood glucose control.
- Instruction on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake, although insulin was not initiated at this stage.

**Follow-up and Recommendations:**
- The patient was discharged on September 22, 2023, with a follow-up appointment scheduled in the endocrinology clinic for October 20, 2023, to reassess glycemic control and adjust the treatment regimen as needed.
- Continued monitoring of HbA1C levels every 3 months was recommended to assess the effectiveness of the treatment plan.
- The importance of adherence to medication, diet, and exercise regimen was emphasized.
- Referral to a diabetes education program for ongoing support and education was arranged.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Metformin 1000 mg orally twice daily
- Statin (specific medication and dosage as per lipid profile results and clinical guidelines)

**Conclusion:**
The patient demonstrated a positive response to the initial treatment and lifestyle modification advice. The patient and family were educated on the chronic nature of type 2 diabetes and the critical importance of adherence to the prescribed treatment and follow-up care to prevent complications and optimize quality of life.
