**Primary Diagnosis:** Arterial Hypertension

**History of Present Illness:**
John Doe, a 54-year-old male with a past medical history significant for obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on September 10, 2023, with complaints of persistent headaches and episodes of dizziness over the past month. The patient reported a family history of hypertension. He denied any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. Home blood pressure readings were consistently above 150/95 mm Hg.

**Hospital Course:**
Upon admission, blood pressure was measured in both arms with readings of 158/100 mm Hg on the right arm and 156/98 mm Hg on the left arm. The right arm was used for subsequent measurements. Physical examination revealed a body mass index (BMI) of 32 kg/mÂ², a waist circumference of 102 cm, and no signs of target organ damage. An initial diagnostic work-up including urinalysis, lipid panel, comprehensive metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and ECG was conducted. The patient's fasting plasma glucose was 126 mg/dL, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Lipid panel showed elevated LDL cholesterol levels. The ECG was normal.

Given the patient's history and diagnostic findings, a diagnosis of arterial hypertension was made. The treatment plan included lifestyle modifications and pharmacotherapy. 

**Medications Prescribed:**
- **Lisinopril** (an ACE inhibitor), initiated at 10 mg orally once daily, titrated to 20 mg once daily after 5 days due to persistent elevated blood pressure readings.
- **Hydrochlorothiazide** (a thiazide diuretic), 12.5 mg orally once daily, initiated in combination with Lisinopril to achieve better blood pressure control.
- **Metformin** for type 2 diabetes mellitus was continued at a dose of 500 mg twice daily.
- **Atorvastatin** 20 mg once daily at bedtime for dyslipidemia.

**Lifestyle Modifications:**
John was counseled on the importance of lifestyle changes including:
- Adopting a DASH diet to reduce sodium intake to less than 1500 mg/day and increase the intake of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.
- Engaging in regular physical activity, with a goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.
- Aiming for a weight loss of 5-10% of body weight over the next 6 months.
- Smoking cessation was not applicable as the patient did not smoke.

**Follow-Up and Education:**
- The patient was educated on the importance of medication adherence and was taught how to monitor his blood pressure at home.
- He was advised to return to the clinic for a follow-up visit in 4 weeks to assess blood pressure control and medication side effects, with subsequent visits every 3 months or as recommended.
- Instructions were given on recognizing symptoms of potential complications related to hypertension and when to seek immediate medical attention.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue prescribed medications as directed.
- Follow the recommended lifestyle modifications.
- Monitor blood pressure at home twice daily and maintain a log.
- Attend all scheduled follow-up appointments.

**Prognosis:**
With adherence to prescribed treatment and lifestyle modifications, the prognosis for managing John's hypertension is good. Regular follow-up is essential for monitoring therapy effectiveness and making necessary adjustments.
