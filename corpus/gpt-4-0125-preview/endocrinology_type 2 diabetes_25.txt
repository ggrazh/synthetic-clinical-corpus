3. **Patient Education:**  
   - Comprehensive education covering the causes of diabetes, recognizing signs and symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and understanding potential complications of diabetes.  
   - Education on adjusting insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and carbohydrate intake was provided, emphasizing the importance of regular monitoring.

4. **Complication Screening:**  
   - A foot examination revealed no signs of neuropathy or circulatory impairment.  
   - Funduscopic examination was within normal limits.  
   - Urine testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine levels were within normal ranges, indicating no immediate kidney complications.

**Discharge Instructions:**

1. **Medications:**  
   - Continue Metformin 500 mg twice daily, increasing to 1000 mg twice daily after one week if no significant gastrointestinal side effects are experienced.
   - Continue semaglutide, increasing the dose as instructed, to manage blood glucose levels effectively and aid in weight reduction.

   - Adhere to the dietary plan as discussed with the dietician, focusing on portion control and nutrient-dense foods.
   - Maintain the prescribed physical activity regimen, adjusting as necessary based on blood glucose monitoring.

   - Schedule a follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Thompson in the Endocrinology Unit for October 10, 2023, to evaluate response to treatment and adjust the management plan as necessary.
   - Regular monitoring of HbA1C levels every three months to assess long-term glucose control.

4. **Vaccinations:**  
   - Ensure up-to-date vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 to reduce the risk of infections.

5. **Professional Podiatric Care:**
