**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Information:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Age:** 52 years  
- **Gender:** Male  
- **Admission Date:** October 11, 2023  
- **Discharge Date:** October 18, 2023  
- **Hospital:** Heart Health Cardiovascular Unit  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presented in the emergency department on October 11, 2023, with complaints of severe headaches and episodes of dizziness over the past week.

**History of Present Illness:**  
John Doe, a 52-year-old male with a past medical history significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, was admitted to the cardiovascular unit on October 11, 2023, after presenting with severe headaches and dizziness. The patient reported experiencing these symptoms intermittently over the past month, with an increase in severity leading to the current hospital visit.

**Physical Examination and Diagnostic Findings:**  
Upon admission, blood pressure (BP) readings were consistently elevated, with initial measurements showing 160/100 mm Hg in both arms. A properly sized BP cuff was used, and the measurements met the criteria for the diagnosis of hypertension. Additional diagnostic testing included urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and ECG, all of which were conducted to assess the patient's overall cardiovascular risk and to screen for target organ damage. The patient's BMI was calculated at 30, indicating obesity.

**Hospital Course:**  
John Doe was initially managed with oral Lisinopril 10 mg once daily, starting on October 12, 2023. Lifestyle modifications were also emphasized, including dietary changes to reduce sodium intake below 1500 mg/day, weight loss recommendations, and initiation of a regular exercise regimen. Despite these interventions, BP readings remained above the target of <130/80 mm Hg. Consequently, Amlodipine 5 mg once daily was added to the regimen on October 14, 2023. The combination therapy led to gradual improvement in BP control, with readings averaging 130/82 mm Hg by October 17, 2023.

**Education Provided:**  
Patient education was a crucial component of John Doe's management plan. He received comprehensive counseling on the importance of adherence to pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modifications for long-term management of hypertension. Instructions were provided on how to monitor his BP at home, recognize symptoms of potential complications, and understand the chronic nature of hypertension. Dietary counseling emphasized reduced sodium intake, healthy eating patterns, and weight loss strategies. Smoking cessation was strongly advised, although the patient denied current tobacco use.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- **Lisinopril** 10 mg orally once daily
- **Amlodipine** 5 mg orally once daily

**Follow-Up:**  
John Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in the outpatient cardiovascular clinic on November 15, 2023. The purpose of the visit is to reassess BP control, evaluate adherence to medication and lifestyle modifications, and adjust the treatment plan as necessary. Regular calibration of the home sphygmomanometer is recommended, with instructions to report any consistent BP readings above the target range or symptoms of potential complications immediately.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Continue with prescribed medications without interruption.  
- Monitor blood pressure twice daily and maintain a log to be reviewed during the follow-up visit.  
- Adhere strictly to the recommended dietary changes and physical activity guidelines.  
- Report any adverse effects of medications or significant changes in health status to the healthcare provider promptly.
