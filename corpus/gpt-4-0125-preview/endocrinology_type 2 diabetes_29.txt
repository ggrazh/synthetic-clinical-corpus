- **Sex:** Male
- **Hospital ID:** 004257JD
- **Date of Admission:** September 12, 2023
- **Date of Discharge:** September 22, 2023
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Emily Stanton, MD, Endocrinology

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**

John Doe was admitted to the endocrinology unit on September 12, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss over the past two months. His medical history included hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Given the clinical presentation and family history of diabetes (mother with type 2 diabetes), an initial assessment pointed towards a possible diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

**Diagnostic Findings:**
- **Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG):** 198 mg/dL on September 13, 2023
- **Glycosylated Hemoglobin (HbA1C):** 9.2% on September 13, 2023
- **Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT):** Conducted on September 14, 2023, indicated a 2-hour glucose level of 310 mg/dL.
- **Random Glucose Value:** 212 mg/dL on September 12, 2023
- Additional screenings revealed albuminuria and an elevated serum creatinine level, suggesting early nephropathy. A comprehensive lipid profile indicated dyslipidemia.

Based on these findings, John Doe was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis was confirmed by Dr. Emily Stanton, and the patient was informed about his condition, including the causes of diabetes, symptoms, and signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and potential complications.

**Treatment and Management:**
- **Medications Initiated:**
  - **Metformin:** 500 mg twice daily, initiated on September 15, 2023. The dosage was planned for gradual titration to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.
  - **Semaglutide:** Initiated at 0.25 mg once weekly on September 17, 2023, with a plan to increase the dose gradually based on tolerance and glycemic control.
  - Antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications were adjusted to optimize cardiovascular risk management.
- **Dietary Counseling:** Provided by a certified dietitian, focusing on whole foods, high-quality carbohydrates, and an individualized meal plan accommodating caloric needs and preferences.
- **Exercise:** Recommended at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with resistance training sessions twice a week. John Doe was counseled on monitoring blood glucose levels before and after exercise and adjusting carbohydrate intake as necessary.
- **Education:** Intensive diabetes education sessions were conducted, covering blood glucose monitoring, insulin dose adjustments, recognition and management of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and foot care. The education emphasized the importance of regular podiatric care.

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**
- A follow-up appointment with Dr. Emily Stanton is scheduled for October 10, 2023, to assess glycemic control, medication tolerability, and the management of comorbid conditions.
- John Doe was advised to monitor his blood glucose levels at home four times a day and keep a log for review at the next visit.
- Vaccinations against Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza virus, hepatitis B, varicella, and SARS-CoV-2 were updated during the hospital stay.
- Referral to an ophthalmologist for a funduscopic examination and a podiatrist for foot care assessment was made.
- John Doe was encouraged to join a local support group for individuals with type 2 diabetes to aid in lifestyle modification and adherence to treatment plans.

**Discharge Medications:**
- Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily
- Semaglutide 0.25 mg subcutaneously once weekly (with plan for dose escalation)
- Lisinopril 20 mg orally once daily for hypertension
