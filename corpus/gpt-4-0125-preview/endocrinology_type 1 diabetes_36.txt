**Summary of Hospital Stay:**

Jordan Matthews, a 33-year-old patient, was admitted to the Endocrinology unit of City General Hospital on June 15, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss over the past month. Initial examination revealed a body mass index (BMI) of 21.2 kg/m^2, blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg, and a heart rate of 88 bpm. The patient reported no significant past medical history or familial history of diabetes.

**Diagnostic Findings:**

Upon admission, a series of diagnostic tests were conducted:

The diagnostic criteria confirmed the diagnosis of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, based on the FPG levels, HbA1C percentage, and random plasma glucose measures. The patient was immediately started on insulin therapy and monitored for initial management and stabilization.

Jordan received comprehensive education on diabetes management, including the importance of diet, exercise, medication adherence, and regular monitoring of blood glucose levels. The patient was counseled on recognizing signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and how to manage these conditions. Dietary recommendations were provided focusing on whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates. Jordan was advised to engage in at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week.

Screening for diabetic complications was planned, with arrangements made for annual foot examinations, funduscopic examinations by an ophthalmologist, and annual testing for albuminuria and serum creatinine measurement. The patient was advised to get lipid profile checks annually and was educated on the importance of regular podiatric care.

**Discharge Medications:**
