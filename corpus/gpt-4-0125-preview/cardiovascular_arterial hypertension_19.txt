Hospital: Saint Heart Cardiovascular Unit

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presented with persistent headaches and episodes of dizziness over the past month.

**History of Present Illness:**  
John Doe reported experiencing severe headaches and occasional dizziness, which prompted him to visit the emergency department. He has a history of untreated elevated blood pressure readings taken sporadically at pharmacy kiosks but never followed up with a healthcare provider until now.

**Medical History:**  
- Hypertension (newly diagnosed)  
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (controlled with Metformin 500 mg BID)  
- Hyperlipidemia (controlled with Atorvastatin 20 mg QD)

**Medications on Admission:**  
- Metformin 500 mg BID  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg QD

**Hospital Course:**  
Upon admission on September 20, 2023, initial blood pressure readings were 162/98 mm Hg and 158/96 mm Hg in the right and left arms, respectively. The higher reading from the right arm was used for subsequent measurements. A comprehensive history and physical examination were performed, including weight, height, and waist circumference measurements. Diagnostic tests including urinalysis, lipid panel, metabolic panel, fasting plasma glucose, and ECG were conducted. The patient's initial diagnostic workup did not reveal any target organ damage.

Given the diagnosis of arterial hypertension, John Doe was started on Lisinopril 10 mg once daily, and lifestyle modifications were strongly recommended, including dietary changes, increased physical activity, and sodium intake reduction.

During his hospital stay, his blood pressure was closely monitored, showing gradual improvement. Home blood pressure monitoring was initiated to assess potential white coat hypertension, with instructions provided on regular calibration of the sphygmomanometer.

**Discharge Medications:**  
1. Lisinopril 10 mg QD - for hypertension  
2. Metformin 500 mg BID - for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus  
3. Atorvastatin 20 mg QD - for hyperlipidemia  

**Lifestyle Modifications:**  
- Diet: Adopt a DASH diet focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, with a reduced content of saturated fats and cholesterol.  
- Physical Activity: Engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week.  
- Sodium Intake: Limit sodium intake to less than 1500 mg/day.  
- Weight Management: Aim for a gradual weight loss to achieve a body mass index (BMI) within the normal range.  
- Smoking Cessation: Patient is encouraged to quit smoking, with resources provided for support.

**Follow-Up:**  
1. Follow up with primary care physician in 1 week for blood pressure monitoring and medication adjustment as needed.  
2. Schedule a visit with the cardiologist in 1 month for a comprehensive evaluation and potential medication titration.  
3. Continue home blood pressure monitoring twice daily and maintain a log to be reviewed during follow-up visits.

**Patient Education:**  
John Doe was educated on the importance of adherence to his medication regimen and lifestyle modifications. He was taught how to monitor his blood pressure at home accurately and instructed on recognizing symptoms that require immediate medical attention. The chronic nature of hypertension and the necessity for lifelong management were emphasized.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
- Adhere strictly to the prescribed medication regimen without any alterations unless advised by a healthcare professional.  
- Implement the recommended lifestyle changes immediately to aid in the management of hypertension.  
- Monitor blood pressure at home as instructed and keep a record for review during follow-up visits.  
- Report any adverse reactions or significant changes in health status to the healthcare provider promptly.

**Summary:**  
John Doe was admitted to the cardiovascular unit with symptoms indicative of uncontrolled hypertension. Through diagnostic evaluation and treatment initiation, his condition has been stabilized. Upon discharge, a comprehensive plan including medication therapy, lifestyle modifications, and follow-up care has been established to manage his hypertension effectively.
