John Doe was admitted to the Endocrinology Unit on October 1, 2023, with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, unexplained weight loss, and general fatigue over the past two months. Given the clinical presentation, a comprehensive metabolic panel and a series of diagnostic tests were ordered to evaluate for diabetes mellitus.

**Diagnostic Findings:**

- **Autoantibodies:** Positive for islet cell antibodies, confirming type 1 diabetes mellitus.  

**Treatment Initiated:**  
Given the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus, an insulin therapy regimen was initiated. John's treatment plan included:
- **Basal Insulin:** Insulin glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime.
- **Bolus Insulin:** Insulin lispro 8 units subcutaneously before meals, adjusted based on carbohydrate intake and pre-meal blood glucose levels.  
- **Dietary Consultation:** A registered dietitian provided education on carbohydrate counting, portion control, and the importance of whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates.  
- **Diabetes Education:** Comprehensive education covering diabetes management, signs of hypo- and hyperglycemia, and the importance of regular monitoring was provided.

**Hospital Course:**  
Throughout his hospital stay, John's blood glucose levels were closely monitored, adjusting insulin dosages as necessary to achieve glycemic control. He demonstrated proficiency in carbohydrate counting, insulin administration, and blood glucose monitoring. Additionally, screenings for diabetic complications, including a comprehensive foot examination and referral for a funduscopic examination, were initiated.

**Discharge Medications:**  
- **Insulin glargine 20 units subcutaneously at bedtime.**  
- **Insulin lispro 8 units subcutaneously before meals, with dose adjustments as necessary.**  

**Follow-Up Care:**  
- **Endocrinology Follow-Up:** Scheduled for November 10, 2023, to assess glycemic control and adjust insulin therapy as needed.
- **Ophthalmology Consultation:** Appointment on November 15, 2023, for a detailed funduscopic examination.
- **Dietary Follow-Up:** Scheduled for November 5, 2023, to reassess dietary habits and make necessary adjustments.
- **Diabetes Education Refresher:** Scheduled for December 1, 2023, to reinforce education on diabetes management.

**Lifestyle Recommendations:**  
- **Exercise:** Encouraged to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week, with adjustments to insulin doses or carbohydrate intake as necessary to manage hypoglycemia risk.
- **Diet:** Emphasize whole foods and high-quality carbohydrates, with attention to portion control and carbohydrate counting.
- **Vaccinations:** Updated influenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines administered. Recommendations to stay current with all vaccinations, including SARS-CoV-2.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
John was instructed to regularly monitor his blood glucose levels four times daily and adjust his bolus insulin doses according to carbohydrate intake and blood glucose readings. He was educated on recognizing symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia and how to respond appropriately. Continuing regular exercise and adhering to dietary recommendations are crucial for his long-term diabetes management. Urged to attend all scheduled follow-up appointments and consult with his healthcare team if he experiences any issues or has questions regarding his diabetes management.
