**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name:** John Doe  
- **Age:** 58 years  
- **Sex:** Male  
- **Admission Date:** September 10, 2023  
- **Discharge Date:** September 25, 2023  
- **Admitting Physician:** Dr. Jane Smith, Neurologist  
- **Hospital:** City Hospital, Neurology Unit  

**Summary of Hospital Stay:**  
John Doe was admitted to the Neurology Unit of City Hospital on September 10, 2023, following the sudden onset of a severe headache, right-sided weakness, and difficulty speaking. These symptoms began abruptly on the morning of admission. Mr. Doe has a history of hypertension and was on medication (Lisinopril 20 mg daily). His past medical history is also notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, managed with Metformin 500 mg twice daily.

**Diagnostic Assessment:**  
Upon arrival, Mr. Doe's blood glucose was immediately measured, revealing a level of 180 mg/dL, ruling out hypoglycemia as a cause of his symptoms. A complete blood count and coagulation studies were promptly performed, showing no significant abnormalities. An urgent CT scan of the brain was conducted, revealing a left-sided intracerebral hemorrhage. No anticoagulants or antiplatelet medications were reported by the patient. However, given the patient's history of hypertension, it was considered a significant contributing factor to his hemorrhagic stroke.

**Treatment Course:**  
Initial management included strict blood pressure control. Mr. Doe was started on intravenous nicardipine, beginning at 2.5 mg/hour and titrated up to a maximum of 10 mg/hour to maintain a target systolic blood pressure between 140 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. This regimen successfully kept his blood pressure within the desired range without significant fluctuations.

Due to the size of the hemorrhage and initial concerns for potential midline shift, neurosurgery was consulted. However, it was determined that the patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention based on the hemorrhage's location and the high risk of postoperative complications.

Throughout his hospital stay, Mr. Doe's neurological status was closely monitored. He showed gradual improvement in his right-sided weakness and speech difficulties through the dedicated work of the multidisciplinary team, including neurology, nursing, physical therapy, and speech therapy.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Lisinopril 20 mg orally once daily for hypertension  
- Metformin 500 mg orally twice daily for type 2 diabetes  
- Nicardipine was discontinued, and Mr. Doe was transitioned to amlodipine 10 mg orally once daily for long-term blood pressure management  
- No antiseizure medications were prescribed as Mr. Doe did not experience any seizures during his hospital stay  

**Follow-Up and Recommendations:**  
Mr. Doe is scheduled for a follow-up appointment with Dr. Jane Smith in two weeks to reassess his neurological status and blood pressure management. He has been advised to monitor his blood pressure at home, aiming for readings close to 130/80 mm Hg. He has also been referred to outpatient physical therapy and speech therapy to continue his rehabilitation.

Mr. Doe and his family have been educated on the signs of potential rebleeding, such as sudden headache, increased weakness, or changes in consciousness, and have been advised to seek immediate medical attention if these occur.

**Conclusion:**  
Mr. John Doe's hospital stay from September 10, 2023, to September 25, 2023, for the management of an intracerebral hemorrhage was marked by careful monitoring, aggressive blood pressure management, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation efforts. His discharge plan includes close follow-up, continued rehabilitation, and strict blood pressure control to prevent future cerebrovascular events.
