**Patient Discharge Summary**

**Patient Details:**  
- **Name**: John Doe  
- **Age**: 35 years  
- **Sex**: Male  
- **MRN**: 123456789  
- **Date of Admission**: April 5, 2023  
- **Date of Discharge**: April 12, 2023  
- **Admitting Physician**: Dr. Emily Stanton  
- **Primary Diagnosis**: Influenza  

**Hospital Course and Treatment:**  
Mr. John Doe presented to the emergency department on April 5, 2023, with a 2-day history of high fever, cough, body aches, and fatigue. Given the presence of influenza in the community and his presenting symptoms, influenza was suspected. Initial management consisted of supportive care including hydration and antipyretics, specifically acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 4 hours as needed for fever.

A rapid antigen test for influenza was performed upon admission, yielding a positive result for Influenza A. Due to the sensitivity and specificity concerns associated with rapid antigen tests, and the fact that Mr. Doe required hospitalization, an RT-PCR test was also conducted, confirming the diagnosis of Influenza A.

Given the severity of Mr. Doe's symptoms and his need for hospitalization, antiviral therapy was initiated. Oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice a day was started on April 5, 2023, within hours of admission, and continued for a 5-day course. This was in line with recommendations for high-risk patients to decrease the duration of fever, symptom severity, and time to return to normal activity. Mr. Doe's medical history was reviewed to ensure no contraindications to the prescribed medications.

Throughout his hospital stay, Mr. Doe was monitored for complications, including secondary bacterial pneumonia. Pulse oximetry consistently showed satisfactory oxygen saturation above 95% on room air, and a chest x-ray performed on April 6, 2023, revealed no signs of pneumonia, only showing findings consistent with viral infection, such as interstitial infiltrates.

Mr. Doe's condition gradually improved over the course of his hospital stay, with resolution of fever by April 8, 2023, and significant improvement in cough and fatigue. He was able to maintain adequate hydration and nutrition orally, and no further complications were noted.

**Discharge Instructions:**  
Mr. Doe has been advised to continue resting at home and to maintain adequate hydration. While his antiviral therapy with Oseltamivir has been completed, he is advised to monitor his temperature and symptoms closely. Should he experience any worsening of symptoms or difficulty breathing, he is to seek immediate medical attention.

A follow-up appointment with his primary care physician, Dr. Sarah Lin, has been scheduled for April 19, 2023, to ensure complete recovery. Mr. Doe has been advised to avoid contact with others as much as possible until he has been symptom-free for at least 24 hours, to prevent the spread of the virus.

**Medications at Discharge:**  
- Acetaminophen 650 mg orally every 4 hours as needed for fever or pain.

**Precautions:**  
- Avoid aspirin due to the risk of Reye's syndrome.  
- Practice good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette.

**Follow-up Care:**  
- Follow-up with Dr. Sarah Lin on April 19, 2023.
