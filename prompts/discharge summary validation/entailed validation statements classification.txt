You are a medical doctor's AI assistant. Your task is to fact-check a discharge summary of a patient diagnosed with {diagnosis}. Given the following list of statements, determine whether they are entailed or contradicted by the discharge summary text. Return the result as a JSON array. 

Examples of entailed statements:
{
    "statement": "The discharge summary must state that levothyroxine was the treatment initiated for hypothyroidism, including the dosage and considerations for the patient's age, body mass index, and absorption.",
    "discharge_summary_context": "The patient was started on levothyroxine therapy with an initial dose of 100 mcg orally once a day based on the patient's age, body mass index, and absorption.",
    "verdict": "entailment",
    "explanation": "The discharge summary includes all of the information required by the statement, so the statement is supported by the discharge summary."
},
{
    "statement": "If clinical findings suggested acute bacterial meningitis, the summary must confirm that antibiotics and corticosteroids were administered immediately after blood cultures were taken, even before the lumbar puncture",
    "discharge_summary_context": "Given his clinical presentation and suspected diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis, blood cultures were taken immediately. The patient was started on empiric antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone 2g IV every 12 hours and vancomycin 1g IV every 12 hours, as well as dexamethasone 10mg IV every 6 hours.",
    "verdict": "entailment",
    "explanation": "The discharge summary mentions that acute bacterial meningitis was suspected by the clinical findings, and as a result, antibiotics (ceftriaxone and vancomycin) and corticosteroids (dexamethasone) were administered immediately."
},
{
    "statement": "The discharge summary must specify the type of imaging studies conducted and the findings that confirmed the presence of an ankle fracture",
    "discharge_summary_context": "On admission, ankle x-rays were taken in anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views, revealing a displaced lateral malleolus fracture and a non-displaced medial malleolus fracture. The Ottawa ankle rules were applied, and Mr. Smith met the criteria for imaging due to his inability to bear weight immediately after the injury and bone tenderness within 6 cm of the posterior edge of the malleolus. Additionally, knee x-rays were performed to rule out associated injuries, and no abnormalities were detected.",
    "verdict": "entailment",
    "explanation": "The discharge summary specifies the type of imaging studies conducted and the findings that confirmed the presence of an ankle fracture."
},
{
    "statement": "If an HbA1C level of ≥ 6.5% was identified, the summary must confirm the diagnosis of diabetes.",
    "discharge_summary_context": "Upon admission, Mr. Smith underwent a series of diagnostic tests including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT). His FPG was 250 mg/dL, HbA1C was 7.8%, and OGTT confirmed the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.",
    "verdict": "entailment",
    "explanation": "The discharge summary mentions that the statment condition of HbA1C level of ≥ 6.5% was met (HbA1C was 7.8%) and the diagnosed of type 1 diabetes was confirmed."
},
{
    "statement": "The discharge summary must confirm that adamantanes were not used for treatment due to widespread resistance.",
    "discharge_summary_context": "The discharge summary does not mention adamantanes usage for treatment.",
    "verdict": "entailment",
    "explanation": "Since no adamantanes usage is mentioned in the discharge summary, the statement is fulfilled."
}

Examples of contradicted statements:
{
    "statement": "If displaced fractures were present, the summary must document that open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) was performed or recommended.",
    "discharge_summary_context": "Displaced fractures were present, they were splinted and a close follow-up was scheduled.",
    "verdict": "contradiction",
    "explanation": "The discharge summary states that although displaced fractures were present, no open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) was performed or recommended. Instead, the fractures were splinted, which contradicts the statement."
},
{
    "statement": "The discharge summary must outline the treatment plan, including nonpharmacological interventions and any antihypertensive medications prescribed.",
    "discharge_summary_context": "The discharge summary outlines the treatment plan including nonpharmacological interventions but does not include any information about medications prescribed.",
    "verdict": "contradiction",
    "explanation": "The statement is contradicted because the discharge summary does not include an important part of the information required by the statement (any antihypertensive medications prescribed)"
},
{
    "statement": "If anemia was present, the summary must describe its type and severity, including hemoglobin levels.",
    "discharge_summary_context": "The discharge summary mentions that anemia was present but does not include any details about its type and severity.",
    "verdict": "contradiction",
    "explanation": "The statement is contradicted because the discharge summary does not describe the anemia type and its severity."
},
{
    "statement": "If diagnostic tests were performed, the summary must indicate that these were conducted after an 8- to 12-hour fast or 2 hours after ingestion of a concentrated glucose solution, as appropriate.",
    "discharge_summary_context": "Upon admission, Mr. Smith underwent a series of diagnostic tests including fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT).",
    "verdict": "contradiction",
    "explanation": "The summary states that diagnostic tests were performed. However, it does not indicate that these were conducted after an 8- to 12-hour fast or 2 hours after ingestion of a concentrated glucose solution, which is a required information for the statement to hold."
