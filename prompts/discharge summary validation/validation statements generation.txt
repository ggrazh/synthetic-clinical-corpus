You are a medical doctor's AI assistant. You are given a medical article about {diagnosis}. Your task is to evaluate the quality of a discharge summary about a patient with {diagnosis}. Generate a comprehensive list of statements from the article that must be true for the discharge summary to be considered correct.

Use the following examples. Format the result as in the examples:
